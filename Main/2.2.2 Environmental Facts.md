This lesson covers the following topics:

- Disposal
- Air quality
- Cleaning

## Disposal

It is important to ensure that equipment and hazardous chemicals are disposed of properly.

- Consult the manufacturer's documentation for recommended solutions for equipment disposal.
- Consult an MSDS for information on physical data, toxicity, health effects, first aid, storage, disposal, and spill procedures for disposal of hazardous chemicals. You can download a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) from the manufacturer's website or check with a representative of that organization. Your company may also have an MSDS in place for disposal that you can refer to.

The following table offers suggestions for disposing of used equipment:

|Component or Material|Disposal Method|
|---|---|
|Alkaline batteries|Recycle alkaline batteries if possible. Otherwise, dispose of alkaline batteries as your local laws require. For example, in some states, you can throw them in the regular trash. In California, they are considered hazardous waste and are supposed to go with the household hazardous waste collection for special recycling.|
|Button batteries|These are considered hazardous waste because they contain mercuric oxide, lithium, silver oxide, or zinc-air. Return them to the manufacturer, recycle them, or contact local authorities for disposal procedures.|
|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries|Recycle NiMH batteries. Lithium batteries are considered a non-hazardous waste.|
|CRT monitor|Contact local authorities for recycling CRTs. They contain many toxic and caustic substances that are illegal to incinerate. Discharge CRTs before disposal, as they can contain high voltages.|
|PC system|Recycle, give it away, or resell old PC systems. A typical PC contains $5 to $25 worth of precious metals. Remember to clean the hard drive before disposing of the machine.|
|Power supply|Contact local authorities for regulations. Recycle power supplies if possible. Discharge before disposal, as they contain high voltages.|
|Laser printer toner cartridges|Return cartriges to the manufacturer for recycling (to clean up spills, use a toner vacuum or a scoop and a damp cloth; never use a regular vacuum).|
|Inkjet printer cartridges|Recycle these cartridges. You can return the cartridges to the manufacturer for recycling or recycle them yourself.|
|Cleaning solutions and solvents|Consult the MSDS, a licensed disposal organization, or local authorities for handling and authorized disposal procedures for solutions and solvents.|

## Air Quality

Computer systems do not function well if they get too cold or too hot or too humid or too dry. Poor environmental conditions can reduce the life of network components, as well as decrease their reliability over time.

The following chart provides information on a few air quality factors.

|Factor|Description|
|---|---|
|Temperature|The hotter computer equipment runs, the faster it ages and degrades. And if a system is hot enough, it is possible for hardware components to be destroyed.<br><br>- Internal fans and cooling systems can typically maintain the internal temperature of your computers.<br>- External temperatures of offices, server rooms, and data centers should be monitored.<br>- The general guideline is to try to keep the temperature at 68-degrees Fahrenheit, but cooler temperatures can be even better especially in server rooms and data centers where there are a lot of systems close together.|
|Humidity|Computer systems do not function well with too much or too little humidity. Computers are designed to operate within a humidity range, so you need to monitor the humidity within your organization, especially in your server rooms and data centers. Too much humidity can result in condensation. Too little humidity can result in electrostatic discharges. The drier the air, the more easily static sparks can jump and damage components. The recommended humidity level is usually between 40 and 60%.|
|Ventilation|Good ventilation can go a long way in maintaining temperature, humidity, and airflow. PCs and laptops should be used in an area where there is plenty of space for air to flow in and out. Server rooms and data centers often use hot and cold aisles that are designed to ensure that hot air is removed, and cool air is pushed into the room.|

## Cleaning

A buildup of dirt and dust can slow or even stop mechanical parts and cause your computer to overheat.

The following cleaning tools can be used to maintain your systems:

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|Computer vacuum|Used to remove small bits of dust and dirt. Be careful using near small components.|
|Damp cloth|A damp cloth with mild soap and water can be used to clean the outside of a computer and monitor. Be sure to unplug any electronic device before cleaning with water.|
|Denatured isopropyl alcohol|Denatured alcohol can be used to clean metal contacts (like those found on expansion cards).|
|Compressed air|Use compressed air to blow small particles of dust and dirt from inside your device.|
