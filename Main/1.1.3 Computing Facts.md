## Computer Categories

Computers are made up of several components. These components can be divided into two main categories:

|Category|Description|
|---|---|
|Hardware|The physical components that compose a computer system or network. Common hardware components include:<br><br>- Keyboard, mouse, monitor, and printer.<br>- Connectors and cables.<br>- Hard disk drives.<br>- Circuit boards.|
|Software|Instructions or data that are stored electronically, either on a hard drive or a special chip. Software components include:<br><br>- Operating systems.<br>- Program applications.<br>- Hardware drivers (special programs that tell the operating system how to use the hardware).<br><br>_Firmware_ is a special type of software that is embedded in the read-only memory of a hardware component. A BIOS chip is an example of firmware.|

## Computer Functions

Computer hardware is categorized based on the function it performs.

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Input|The movement of data or commands to the internal computer hardware. Input devices include:<br><br>- Standard input devices:<br>    - Mouse<br>    - Keyboard<br>    - Touchscreen<br>- Gaming input devices:<br>    - Game controller<br>    - Joystick<br>- Media input devices:<br>    - Scanner<br>    - Digital camera<br>    - Webcam<br>- Audio input devices:<br>    - Microphone<br>    - MIDI controller|
|Processing|The flow of data through a series of procedures as defined by a set of instructions. Major processing components include:<br><br>- Central processing unit (CPU)<br>- Random-access memory (RAM)<br>    <br>    RAM is temporary, short-term storage used to store processed information for quick access. RAM is considered volatile memory because it is non-persistent. _Non-persistent_ means when the computer is turned off, all the data that was stored in RAM is lost.|
|Storage devices|Devices that contain non-volatile memory for saving or maintaining data. Storage devices include:<br><br>- Hard disk drives<br>- Solid-state drives<br>- Optical drives (CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, and Blu-ray)<br>- Flash drives|
|Output|The process of the computer presenting, displaying, or otherwise giving data. Output devices include:<br><br>- Video<br>- Audio<br>- Printing|
|Networking and communications|The practice of connecting two or more computers to transfer data. Networking components include:<br><br>- Connecting media:<br>    - Copper cables<br>    - Radio signals<br>- Connection devices:<br>    - Routers<br>    - Switches|

## Hardware Components

Modern hardware components use a modular design that implements both componentization and standardization as described in the following table.

|Modular Design|Description|
|---|---|
|Componentization|A functional PC is a combination of parts. Each part is considered a field-replaceable unit (FRU), meaning it can be quickly replaced when faulty or easily upgraded when needed. Componentization keeps maintenance costs low and reduces downtime.|
|Standardization|Specifications allow components from different manufacturers to be interchangeable. If a component meets the specified standards, it will work in the computer regardless of manufacturer.|
