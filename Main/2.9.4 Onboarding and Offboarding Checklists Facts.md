## Onboarding

Onboarding is the process followed when setting up a partnership with a new employee. While this process primarily involves HR paperwork, it also involves setting up a work environment for the employee. There are a few onboarding procedures that security professionals should understand.

The following table includes items that you see in most onboarding checklists:

|Action|Description|
|---|---|
|Complete paperwork|In most cases, the Human Resources department will ensure the completion of documentation. However, if applicable, you will want to verify that all security documentation has been reviewed and signed. This could include:<br><br>- Acceptable use policy (AUP)<br>- Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)<br>- Bring your own device policy (BYOD)|
|Verify access|Verify that the user has been granted access to all needed software and hardware. This may include:<br><br>- Install equipment (laptop, monitor, mouse, keyboard, phone)<br>- Install software including:<br>    - Productivity software<br>    - Messaging software<br>    - Email<br>    - Analytical tools<br>    - Ticketing software<br>- Create new accounts including:<br>    - Email<br>    - Single sign-on account<br>    - Phone extension and voicemail|
|Train the employee|Verify that all employees:<br><br>- Know how to access and use all software and hardware.<br>- Verify that employees have been trained in all areas covered by the employee education and awareness policy. This could include training the employee to not:<br>    - Click on links in a phishing email.<br>    - Visit malicious websites.<br>    - Respond to social engineering attempts.<br>    - Download and install unauthorized software.<br>    - Connect unauthorized devices.<br><br>Employees should be provided information about the organization's:<br><br>- Security policy.<br>- Help desk contact information.<br>- Process for reporting suspicious activity.<br>- Knowledge base.|

## Offboarding

Offboarding is the process followed when ending a relationship with an employee. When an employee leaves, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, ensure that you have completed all items on the organization's offboarding checklist. Failure to do so could result in security vulnerabilities.

Be sure to:

- Collect physical access items such as:
    - Keys.
    - Key fobs.
    - Smart cards.
- Disable electronic access, including:
    - Close user accounts.
    - Disable individual access codes and passwords.
    - Change shared access codes and passwords.
    - Terminate access to the email account; forward emails if appropriate.
- Gather company-owned assets including:
    - Laptop.
    - Phone.
    - Uniform.
