# Thermodynamic Systems

- Closed System: Does not exchange matter with surrounding, but can exchange energy
- Open System: Can exchange energy and matter with surroundings
- Isolated System: Doesn't exchange energy or matter

# Pressure, Thermal Equilibrium, and the Ideal Gas Law

## Definitions

- Thermal energy is the energy due to increase in the temperature of the substance which leads to faster and more frequent collisions between gas atoms
- Heat is how much thermal energy is transferred from one object to another
- Temperature is a measure of an objects internal energy, it tells us how much thermal energy an object has. Temperature is directly related to kinetic energy as described by the equation $KE = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)k_{b}T$ where $k_{b}$ is the Boltzmann constant
- Thermal Equilibrium is when there is no overall or net transfer of heat between objects

## The Ideal Gas Law

- The ideal gas law is $PV = nRT$
- We can also use a version of the ideal gas law that states $PV = Nk_{b}T$ where $N$ is the number of molecules

# Heat and Energy Transfer

- Conduction is thermal energy transfer through touch
- Convection is heat transfer through the movement of a heated fluid such as air or water
- Radiation is the transfer of hear through electromagnetic waves
- Energy is represented by Q
