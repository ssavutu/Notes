# Fluids Practice Problems

$$
\begin{align}
1Pa = \frac{1N}{m^2}\\
1kpa = 1000pa\\
1atm = 101.3kpa\\
P  = \frac{F}{A}
\end{align}
$$

$F \uparrow$ $P\uparrow$
$A\uparrow$ $P \downarrow$

Bernoulli's Equation
$$
P_{1} + \frac{1}{2}\rho V_{1}^2 + \rho gh = P_{2} = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2_{2} + \rho gh_{2}
$$

Rate of Flow Equation
$$
A_{1}V_{1} = A_{2}V_{2}
$$
1. Water flows through a horizontal pipe with a cross sectional area of $4m^2$ at a speed of 5m/s with a pressure of 300,000 Pa at point A. At point B, the cross sectional area is $2m^2$. (a) What is the speed of water at point B?. (b) Calculate the pressure at point B.
(A)
	$4 \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot V_{2}$
	
	$\frac{20}{2} = 10 = V_{2}$
	10 m/s

(B)
