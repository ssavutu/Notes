# Domains

- ferro-magnetic materials are made up of various domains with a north and south pole
- when under a magnetic field the domains will organize themselves magnetizing the material

# Right Hand Rules
- But $\vec{B}$ also exerts $F_{B}$ on $q$ but only if it has a $\vec{v}$ that is $\perp$ to $\vec{B}$ 
- $\vec{F} = q\vec{v}\cdot \vec{B}$ which equates to $F = qvB\sin \theta$ with $\theta$ being the angle between $v$ and $B$
- So $F = qvB$ when $v$ and $B$ are $\perp$

F =  qvB \approx F = I\ell B
$$
- Wires also create magnetic fields in loops around the wire, this can be show by the second right hand rule
## RHR #2
thumb $\to$ current
curled fingers $\to$ direction of the field

You can find the strength of the magnetic field by the wire using the formula 
$$B = \frac{M_{0}I}{2\pi R}$$
$M_{0} = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$
