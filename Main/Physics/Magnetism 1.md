# Questions:

## 1.  
A compass needle is not always balanced parallel to the Earth’s surface but one end may dip downward.  Explain why this happens.
    
### GPT:
  The dipping of a compass needle is due to the inclination of the Earth's magnetic field, which is not perfectly aligned with the planet's rotational axis. The magnetic field is inclined at an angle to the surface, and this means that the magnetic force exerted on a compass needle has both horizontal and vertical components. The angle of inclination varies depending on the location on the Earth's surface, with the magnetic field being horizontal at the equator and increasingly inclined towards the poles. The compass needle itself is magnetized and aligns with the Earth's magnetic field, pointing towards magnetic north. The interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and the magnetic properties of the needle causes one end of the needle to dip downward when the magnetic force has a vertical component.

### Grade: B to C+

The answer is technically correct but is so wordy that it becomes difficult to understand what it is trying to say. In addition it doesn't clarify where this phenomenon would occur. I think the answer should have been shortened down, and re-written for clarity. Because it talks around the answer but never clearly states its opinion, I think it deserves a mid-range grade.

## 2.
Suppose you have three iron rods, two of which are magnetized but the third is not.  How would you determine which two are the magnets without using any additional objects?

### GPT:

  To determine which two iron rods are magnetized without using any additional objects, you could perform a simple test using the third, non-magnetized rod. Rub one of the suspected magnetized rods along the length of the non-magnetized rod in one direction, and then try to pick up the other suspected magnetized rod with the end of the non-magnetized rod that was not rubbed. If the second suspected magnetized rod is attracted to the non-magnetized rod, it is likely that the first rod is a magnet since it was able to induce a magnetic field in the non-magnetized rod. Repeat this process with the other suspected magnetized rod to confirm which two rods are actually magnets. If neither of the suspected magnetized rods attracts the non-magnetized rod, then neither is a magnet.
  
### Grade: D

The answer ignores the fact that a magnetized rod and a non magnetized rod would still be attracted to each other. It's also assuming that you would know from the start which rod is non-magnetized, which would remove the need for any further testing, as that would mean the remaining two are magnetized. Overall, the answer is written in a way that sounds smart and uses key concepts, but also without internal logic. 

## 3.
A horseshoe magnet is held vertically, with the north pole on the left and South Pole on the right.  A wire passes between the poles, equidistant from them, and carries a current directly away from you.  In what direction is the force on the wire?
    

### GPT:

  According to the right-hand rule, if a current-carrying wire is placed in a magnetic field, the direction of the force on the wire can be determined by pointing the thumb of the right hand in the direction of the current flow, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field. The direction of the force is then perpendicular to both the direction of the current and the direction of the magnetic field, and can be determined by the direction of the palm of the hand.
  
  In this case, the current is flowing directly away from you, and the north pole of the horseshoe magnet is on the left, while the south pole is on the right. Therefore, the magnetic field direction is from the north pole towards the south pole of the horseshoe magnet, which is to the right of the wire. If the thumb of the right hand is pointed in the direction of the current flow (away from you) and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field (to the right), then the direction of the force on the wire is out of the palm of the hand, which is upwards. Thus, the force on the wire is upward.


### Grade: A
  The answer correctly explains a version of the right hand rule, and correctly determines the direction of the force.

## 4.
Explain why a strong magnet held near an old television screen causes the picture to become distorted.  
    
### GPT:
  This phenomenon occurs because old television screens were not designed to handle strong magnetic fields. When a strong magnet is held near the screen, it creates a temporary magnetic field that interferes with the electron beams inside the television, causing the picture to become distorted. The electrons become magnetically charged and start moving in circular paths, causing the picture to appear distorted and fuzzy. This effect is only temporary, and the picture will return to normal once the magnet is removed.
  
  ### Grade: B+ to A-
  This answer is essentially correct in that the magnet interferes with the electron beams, but while it does explain how it's possible that this will make the image fuzzy, it ignores what we saw in class, where the image stayed clear but the colors flipped. Overall I think it provides a good explanation of what happens when a magnet comes near a CRT.

## 5.
Can you set a resting electron into motion with a magnetic field?  An electric field?
    

  ### GPT:

  In the case of a magnetic field, the force experienced by a charged particle (such as an electron) is given by the Lorentz force law. This law states that the force on a charged particle is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field and the velocity of the particle, as well as the charge of the particle. Therefore, if a magnetic field is applied to a stationary electron, it will experience a force that will cause it to move in a circular path around the magnetic field lines.
  
  Similarly, an electric field can also be used to set a resting electron into motion. The force experienced by a charged particle in an electric field is given by Coulomb's law. If an electric field is applied to a stationary electron, it will experience a force that will cause it to move in the direction of the electric field lines.

  
### Grade: A-
  I don't think that we learned specifically about the Lorentz Force law in class, but from what I've found about it this seems to be a correct explanation. The explanation of Coulombs law also seems correct.

## 6.
A particle that has an $8.2 \mu C$ charge moves with a velocity of magnitude $5.0 \times 10^5 m/s$ along the $+x$ axis. It experiences no magnetic force, although there is a magnetic field present. The maximum possible magnetic force that the charge could experience has a magnitude of $0.48 N$. Find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field. Note that there are two possible answers for the direction of the field.

$$
\begin{align}
q = 8.2 \mu C \\
  \\
V = 5.0 \times 10^5 m / s \\
  \\
F_{b} = 0.48 \\
\\
B = \frac{0.48}{(8.2 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (5.0\times {10}^5)} \\
   \\
B = .117 \\
\end{align}
$$
The direction of the magnetic field could be $+x$ or $-x$.

## 16. 
A proton is projected perpendicularly into a magnetic field that has a magnitude of 0.50 T. The field is then adjusted so that an electron will follow a circular path of the same radius when it is projected perpendicularly into the field with the same velocity that the proton had. What is the magnitude of the field used for the electron?

$$
\begin{align}
B = 0.50T \\ \\

r = \frac{mV}{|q| B} \\ \\
\end{align}
$$
Because we know that the first particle was a proton and the second particle was a electron, and they will have the same radius, we can set up a pair of equations where one of the particles is a proton and one of the particles is an electron.

$$
\begin{align}
r = \frac{m_{p}V_{p}}{pB_{p}} = \frac{m_{e}V_{e}}{eB_{e}} \\ \\
\end{align}
$$
So now since we know that the absolute value of the charge of a proton and the charge of an electron are equal to each other we can cancel out the elements that we know are equal to each other and solve for the magnitude of the second equation.
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{m_{e}V_{e}|p|B_{p} = m_{p}V_{p}|e|B_{e}}{|e| \cdot V_{e}} \\
  \\

\end{align}
$$
Because we know that the particles are a proton and an electron, we can look up the values of these particles and substitute them in. Then we can substitute in the magnitude of the first magnetic field and solve.
$$
\begin{align}
m_{p} = 1.67262192 \times 10^{-27}\\ \\
m_{e} = 9.1093837015 \times 10^{−31}\\  \\
(9.1093837015 \times 10^{−31})\cdot 0.50 = (1.67262192 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot B_{e} \\
  \\
B_{e} = \frac{(9.1093837015 \times 10^{−31})\cdot 0.50}{(1.67262192 \times 10^{-27})} \\
  \\
B_{e} = 2.723 \times 10^{-4}
\end{align}
$$
## 30. 
At New York City, the earth’s magnetic field has a vertical component of $5.2 \times 10^{-5} T$ that points downward (perpendicular to the ground) and a horizontal component of $1.8 \times 10^{-5} T$  that points toward geographic north (parallel to the ground). What are the magnitude and direction of the magnetic force on a $6.0-m$ long, straight wire that carries a current of $28 A$ perpendicularly into the ground?

$$
\begin{align}
F_{b} = I\ell B \sin \theta
  \\
F_{b} = I\ell B \\
  \\
F_{b} = 28 \cdot 6 \cdot (5.2 \times 10^{-5}) \\
  \\
F_{b} = 0.008736
\end{align}
$$
The direction of the force would be to the east.

## 32. 
A straight wire in a magnetic field experiences a force of $0.030 N$ when the current in the wire is $2.7 A$. The current in the wire is changed, and the wire experiences a force of 0.047 N as a result. What is the new current?

$$
\begin{align}
F_{b} = I\ell B = qVB \\ \\

I\ell B = I_{2}\ell B  \\
  \\
F = F_{2}\\ \\

\frac{F_{1}}{F_{2}} = \frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}} \\ \\

\frac{0.030}{0.047} = \frac{2.7}{I_{2}} \\ \\

I_{2} = 4.23A
\end{align}
$$
