## $\beta$ Decay

- $\beta^-$ rays are are electrons
- $\beta^-$ decay causes a transmutation of one element into another
- The conservation laws are obeyed
- General form of $\beta-$ decay:

- The electron emitted in the day does not exist within the parent nucleus and is not one of the orbital electrons
- The electron is created when a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the electron is normally fast moving and escapes from the atom, the nucleon number remains unchanged
- Energy is released during $\beta^-$ decay

## $\gamma$ Decay

- when a nucleus changes from an exited energy state to a lower energy state a photon is emitted, with nuclear energy levels the photon that is emitted has higher energy levels and is called a $\gamma$ ray
- $\gamma$ decay:

- $\gamma$ decay does not cause a transmutation of one element into the another
## Radioactive Decay and Activity

- Individual disintegrations of a given radioactive nucleus in a group of nuclei are random
- As time passes the number $N$ of parent nuclei decreases, the decrease occurs in a smooth fashion and after enough time $N$ approaches zero 
- The Half Life $T_{\frac{1}{2}}$ of a radioactive isotope is the time required for half of the total nuclei $N$ to disintegrate
	- The value of the half life depends on the nature of the radioactive nucleus, ranging from less than a second to billions of years
- The activity of a radioactive sample is the number of disintegrations per second that occur
	- Every time a disintegration occurs the number $N$ of radioactive nuclei decreases
	- The activity is equal to $\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = -\lambda N$ where $\lambda$ is proportionality constant known as the decay constant
		- The negative sign shows that $N$ is decreasing

## Radioactive Decay Series

- When a unstable parent nucleus decays the resulting daughter nucleus is sometimes also unstable, then the daughter nucleus decays and produces its own daughter, this sequential decay is called a radioactive decay series
