# Fundamental Forces
- Magnetic Force $F_{B}$ = n/a
- Electrostatic Force $F_{E} = \frac{k\cdot q_{1}\cdot q_{2}}{r^2}$ 
- Gravitational Force $F_{G} = \frac{G \cdot m_{1} \cdot m_{2}}{r^2}$

# Magnets
- Magnetism is **not** electric force, it is the result of forces felt by the magnetic field.
- Just like all field forces an object must exhibit magnetic properties to experience force from the magnetic field
- Their is no magnetic "monopole", just North and South
- Magnetic field strength $B$ is measured in teslas $T$.

# Domains
- Magnetic objects have "domains" that contain North and South Poles.
- Introducing a magnetic force can align the domains

# Magnets Get Weird
- Magnets can exert forces on other magnets.
- A magnetic field **can** exert force on a charged particle if:
	- the particle is moving
	- the velocity if the charged particle is perpendicular to the field
