# Fluids Review

## Key Concepts

- Pascal's Principle
	- A pressure change at any point in an incompressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere
- Bernoulli's Principle
	- **Derived from the Law of the Conservation of Energy and Newton's second Law of Motion** Bernoulli's principle states that the increase of the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in potential energy.
- Archimedes's Principle
	- The upward $F_{b}$ on a body immersed in a fluid, whether partially or fully, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body disrupts.
- Hydrostatic Pressure
	- The pressure that is exerted by a fluid at equilibrium at any given point within the fluid due to the force of gravity
- Gauge pressure uses 1 atm as its zero point whereas absolute pressure is the atmospheric pressure + the pressure

## Important Equations
$$
\begin{align}
\rho = \frac{m}{V} && \text{Density Equation}\\ \\
P = \frac{F}{A} && \text{Pressure Equation}\\ \\
P = P_{o} + \rho gh && \text{Pressure at two different heights Equation}\\ \\
F_{b} = \rho Vg && \text{Buoyancy Equation}\\ \\
A_{1}V_{1} = A_{2}V_{2} && \text{Continuity Equation}\\ \\
P_{1} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^2 + \rho gh1 = P_{2} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{2}^2 + \rho gh_{2}
\end{align}
$$
### Important Note: In buoyancy equation both sides are multiplied by gravity so it cancels out.
## Practice Problems

### Conceptual

1. If one material has a higher density than another, does this mean the molecules of the first must be heavier than those of the second?

No, it only means that the molecules are closer together, i.e. more dense.

3. Airplane travelers often note that their cosmetics bottles and other containers have leaked after a trip. What might cause this?

Containers sealed at 1 atm will have 1 atm of pressure inside them. When the airplane travels higher, the pressure of the container's surroundings decrease, so the container forces out its contents until the pressure equalizes.

5. Why does the canvas top of a convertible bulge out when the car is traveling at high
speed?

Because of Bernoulli's principle. The air outside the tarp is moving faster than the air inside the tarp, so the tarp is pulled outwards toward the faster moving air.

4. Why does the stream of water from a faucet become narrower as it falls?

According to the continuity equation as area decreases, velocity increases. As the water falls it accelerates, causing the area to decrease.

### Practical
1. A cylindrical storage tank has a radius of 1.22 m. When filled to a height of 3.71 m, it
holds 14300 kg of a liquid industrial solvent. What is the density of the solvent?

$$
\begin{align}
\rho = \frac{m}{V} \\
  \\
m = 14300kg \\
  \\
V = \pi r^2h = 17.348 \\
  \\
  \\
\rho = \frac{14300kg}{17.348} = 822.6 kg/m
\end{align}
$$
#### Correct

2. U.S. currency is printed using intaglio presses that generate a printing pressure of $8.0 \cdot 10^4 lb/in^2$. A $20 bill is $6.1 \cdot 2.6$ inches, calculate the force the press exerts on one side.

$$
\begin{align}
P = \frac{F}{A} \\
  \\
F = P \cdot A \\
  \\
A = 6.1 \cdot 2.6 = 15.86 \\
  \\
F = 15.86 \cdot 8x10^4 \\
  \\
F = 1,268,800lb/in
\end{align}
$$

#### Correct

4. The Mariana trench is located in the floor of the pacific ocean at a depth of about 11,000 m below the surface of the water. The density of seawater is 1025 kg/m^3. (a) If an underwater vehicle were to explore such a depth, what force would the water exert on the vehicles observational window (r = 0.10 m)? (b) For comparison, determine the weight of a jetliner whose mass is 1.2 X 10^5 kg.
$$
\begin{align}
P = P_{o} + \rho gh \\
  \\
101,325 pa = P_{o} = 1025 \cdot 9.81 \cdot (-11,000) \\
  \\  \\
P_{o} = 110,709,075 \\ \\
  \\
P = \frac{F}{A} \\
  \\
110,709,075 \cdot 0.0314159 =  F \\
  \\
F = 3,474,491.591 \\
  \\
  \\
  \\
  \\
\text{Weight of a plane:} && 1.2 \cdot 10^5kg = 1,176,000
\end{align}
$$



7. The density of ice is 917 $kg/m^3$, and the density of seawater is 1025 $kg/m^3$. A swimming  polar bear climbs onto a piece of floating ice that has a volume of 5.2 $m^3$. What is the weight of the heaviest bear that the ice can support without sinking completely below the water?
# Important Note: In bouyancy equation both sides are multiplied by gravity so it cancels out.
$$
\begin{align}
F_{b} = \rho Vg \\
  \\
\text{Weight of ice} && 917 \cdot 5.2 = 4768.4 \\
  \\
F_{b} = 1025\cdot 5.2 = 5330 \\
  \\
5330 - 4768.4 = 561.6 kg
\end{align}
$$


9. The truck is traveling at 27m/s. The density of air is 1.29 kg/m3. By how much does the pressure inside the cargo area exceed the outside pressure?

$$
\begin{align}
P_{1} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^2 + \rho gh1 = P_{2} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{2}^2 + \rho gh_{2}\\ \\
P_{1} = \frac{1}{2}1.29 \cdot 27^2 \\
  \\
P_{1} = 470.205
\end{align}
$$
