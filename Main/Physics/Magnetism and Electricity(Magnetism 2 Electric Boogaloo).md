# Magnetic Fields
- exert forces $F_{B}$ on charged particle if:
	- they are moving
	- some component of the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field
- the resulting magnetic force is perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the velocity(3d dimension).
- the third dimension can be represented by a $X$ or a $\circ$, the directionality can be remembered by viewing the x as the tail of an arrow traveling away from you(into the page), and the dot as the point of an arrow traveling towards you(out of the page).

# Equations
The force of a magnetic field on a particle is given by the formula:
$$
\vec{F_{B}} = q \vec{V} \vec{B} \approx qVB
$$
The force of a magnetic field on a current carrying wire is given by the formula(also known as the Lorenz force):
$$
\vec{F_{B}} = I\ell B = qVB
$$
The radius of the curvature of the path a charged particle takes through an electric field is given by the formula:
$$
F_{B} = \frac{mV^2}{r}
$$
- Current through Wire $\rightarrow$ Magnetic Field
	- $B = \frac{M_{0}I}{2\pi r}$
- Current through Loop of Wire $\rightarrow$ Stronger Magnetic Field
	- $B = M_{0}nI$(number of loops = n)
