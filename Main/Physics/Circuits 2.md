# Questions:  

### 1.  
If two points are at the same potential, does this mean that no work is done in moving a test charge from one point to the other?  Does this imply that no force must be exerted?
    

  $W = q\Delta V$
  $W = q(V_{1}-V_{2})$ and since  $V_{1}$ = $V_{2}$ that means that no work is done.
  
  

### 2.  
How does the energy stored in a capacitor change when a dielectric is inserted if (a) the capacitor is isolated so $Q$ doesn’t change, (b) the capacitor remains connected to a battery so $V$ doesn’t change.
    
#### (A)
  Because $U = \frac{1}{2}CV$ and $Q = CV$ we know that the energy stored in the capacitor doesn't change.
#### (B) 
  Because $C = \frac{\kappa \epsilon_{0}A}{d}$ we know that if $\kappa > 1$ then because $V$ is constant that means that the energy will increase, if $\kappa = 1$  then it stays the same, and if $\kappa < 1$ then it will decrease
  
  

### 3.  
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of holiday lights connected in parallel versus those connected in series.
    

#### Parallel 
- If one bulb fails, none of the other lights will go out
- Bulbs burn brighter as a result of drawing the same voltage as a single bulb, instead of having it split between all of the bulbs
- More expensive to build

#### Series
  - Bulbs will burn less and less bright the more bulbs there are
  - Cheaper to build
  - If one bulb fails it breaks the circuit
  
  
  

### 4.  
Two lightbulbs of resistance $R_1$ and $R_2 (>R_1)$ are connected in series.  Which is brighter?  What if they are connected in parallel?
    

$R_{2}$ will burn brighter because when in series $P = I^2 \cdot R$, so in this case the lightbulb that has a higher resistance will receive more power as the current($I$) is the same for both of them.

If they were connected in parallel then $P = \frac{V^2}{R}$ so the one with the lower resistance($R_{1}$) will burn brighter.
  
  

### 5.

8.  If $R_2$, $R_5$, and $R_7$ increase, $\epsilon$ ____________.
    

### 6.  
In an RC circuit, current flows from the battery until the capacitor is completely charged.  Is the total energy supplied by the battery equal to the total energy stored by the capacitor?  If not, where does the extra energy go?

Yes, theoretically; if energy is lost it is because it radiated off in the form of heat and dissipated.

### 22. 
An electric blanket is connected to a $120V$ outlet and consumes $140W$ of power. What is the resistance of the heater wire in the blanket?

$$
\begin{align}
P = V^2R \\
  \\
R = \frac{P}{V^2} \\ \\

R = \frac{140}{14400} \\
  \\
R = 0.00972\Omega
\end{align}
$$

### 26. 
An MP3 player operates with a voltage of $3.7V$, and is using $0.095W$ of power. Find the current being supplied by the player’s battery.

$$
\begin{align}
P = IV \\
  \\
V = \frac{P}{I} \\
  \\
I = \frac{0.095}{3.7} = 0.02568A
\end{align}
$$


### 44. 
Multiple-Concept Example 9 discusses the physics principles used in this problem. Three resistors, $2.0$, $4.0$, and $6.0$ $\Omega$, are connected in series across a $24V$ battery. Find the power delivered to each resistor.

First, we can simplify the circuit to have only one resistor. Because the circuits are in series we simply add the resistances together. So $R = 12$. Using this we can find the current: $I$.

$$
\begin{align}
V = IR \\
  \\
I = \frac{V}{R} \\
  \\
I = \frac{24}{12} \\
  \\
I = 2A
\end{align}
$$

Now that we know the current, we can find the current and voltage for each resistor in the circuit and use that to calculate the power, using the formula $P = IV$

### 52. 
The drawing shows three different resistors in two different circuits. The battery has a voltage of $V = 24.0V$, and the resistors have values of $R_1 = 50.0 \Omega$, $R_2 = 25.0 \Omega$, and $R_3 = 10.0 \Omega$. (a) For the circuit on the left, determine the current through and the voltage across each resistor. (b) Repeat part (a) for the circuit on the right

### 66. 
The circuit in the drawing contains three identical resistors. Each resistor has a value of 10.0 $\Omega$. Determine the equivalent resistance between the points $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, and $a$ and $c$.

![[Pasted image 20230312194614.png]]


$a,b = 10\Omega$

$b,c = \frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}$ so $REQ = 5\Omega$

$a,c = 15\Omega$ 

### 96. 
Two capacitors are connected to a battery. The battery voltage is $V = 60.0V$, and the capacitances are $C_1 = 2.00 \mu F$ and $C_2 = 4.00 \mu F$. Determine the total energy stored by the two capacitors when they are wired (a) in parallel and (b) in series.

#### (A)
$U = \frac{1}{2}CV$

$\frac{1}{CEQ} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$
$CEQ = \frac{4}{3}$
$U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot 60 = 40$
#### (B)
$CEQ = 4+2=6$
$U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 60 = 180$


### 104. 
A circuit contains a resistor in series with a capacitor, the series combination being connected across the terminals of a battery, as in Figure 20.37a. The time constant for charging the capacitor is 1.5 s when the resistor has a resistance of $2.0 \times 10^4 \Omega$. What would the time constant be if the resistance had a value of $5.2 \times 10^4 \Omega$?

$\tau = RC$
$1.5 = 2.0 \times 10^4\Omega C$
$C = \frac{1.5}{2.0 \times 10^4} = 0.000075$


$\tau = (5.2 \times 10^4)\cdot0.000075 = 3.9 s$
