Two long wires carrying equal currents $I$ are at right angles to each other but don’t quite touch.  Describe the magnetic force each exerts on the other.
    
### GPT:
When two long wires carrying equal currents $I$ are at right angles to each other, they will generate a magnetic field around themselves. The magnetic field lines of each wire will interact with the magnetic field lines of the other wire, leading to a force between the wires.

The force between the wires is known as the magnetic force and is given by the equation: $$F = \frac{μ_{0}\cdot I_{1}\cdot I_{2}\cdot L}{(2\cdot π\cdot d)}$$

where $μ_{0}$ is the permeability of free space, $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the currents in the wires, $L$ is the length of the wires, and $d$ is the distance between the wires.

In this case, both wires carry the same current $I$, so $I_1 = I_2 = I$. The force can be simplified to: $$F = \frac{μ_0 \cdot I^2 \cdot L}{(2 \cdot π \cdot d)}$$

The force is attractive when the wires are parallel and repulsive when they are anti-parallel. When the wires are at right angles to each other, the force between the wires is perpendicular to both wires and is given by: $$F = \frac{μ_{0}\cdot I^2 \cdot L^2}{(2 \cdot π \cdot d^2)}$$

The force decreases as the distance between the wires increases and increases as the current and length of the wires increase.

In summary, when two long wires carrying equal currents $I$ are at right angles to each other, they will exert a perpendicular magnetic force on each other that is attractive or repulsive depending on their orientation.

### Grade: 
B, the equation and explanation seem to make sense, but the explanation is too long and has an unneeded explanation of the relationship between the various variables and the force.


## 5.  
A charged particle moves in a straight line through a particular region of space.  Could there be a nonzero magnetic field in this region?  If so, an example.
    
### GPT:
Yes, there could be a nonzero magnetic field in a region of space through which a charged particle moves in a straight line. This is because the magnetic field is produced by moving charges, and the charged particle moving through the region would produce a magnetic field.

An example of a situation where a charged particle moves in a straight line through a region with a nonzero magnetic field is a particle beam in a cyclotron. In a cyclotron, charged particles such as protons or electrons are accelerated to high speeds and then injected into a magnetic field region, where they travel in a circular path due to the Lorentz force. As they move in a circle, they emit synchrotron radiation, which causes them to lose energy and spiral outward until they are ejected from the magnetic field region.

In this example, the charged particles are moving in a circular path due to the magnetic field, but they are also moving in a straight line tangent to the circle at any given point. Therefore, even though the particles are not moving in a straight line throughout the entire region, there is still a nonzero magnetic field in the region.

### Grade:  
B-, the first paragraph is good but the following 2 paragraphs are unrelated to the point of the question, and add nothing to the already given answer.
  
  

## 6.  
An unmagnetized nail will not attract an unmagnetized paper clip.  However, if one end of the nail is in contact with a magnet, the other end will attract a paperclip.  Explain.
    
### GPT:
An unmagnetized nail and an unmagnetized paper clip do not have any magnetic fields of their own, and therefore do not exert any magnetic force on each other. The absence of magnetic attraction between them is due to the lack of a magnetic field.

However, if one end of the nail is brought into contact with a magnet, it becomes magnetized. The magnet induces a magnetic field in the nail, and the nail becomes a temporary magnet. The end of the nail that was in contact with the magnet becomes a north pole, while the other end becomes a south pole.

The magnetic field produced by the nail then exerts a magnetic force on the paper clip. The paper clip, being a ferromagnetic material, is attracted to the magnetic field and will be drawn towards the south pole of the nail.


### Grade: 
A-, I think the explanation is good, but I don't think that we would know which end of the nail is the north or south pole and Chat GPT decides which ends are what poles.

### 34 
The drawing shows a wire composed of three segments, AB, BC, and CD. There is a current of $I = 2.8 A$ in the wire. There is also a magnetic field $\vec{B} (\text{Magnitude = 0.26T})$ that is the same everywhere and points in the direction of the $+z$ axis. The lengths of the wire segments are $L_{AB} = 1.1m$, $L_{BC} = 0.55m$, and $L_{CD} = 0.55m$. Find the magnitude of the force that acts on each segment

#### AB
$$
\begin{align}
F_{B} = I\ell B \\
I = 2.8 \\
\ell = 1.1 \\
B =0.26 \\
F_{B} = 2.8 \cdot 1.1 \cdot 0.26 \\
F_{B} = 0.8008
\end{align}
$$
#### BC
$$
\begin{align}
F_{B} = I\ell B \\
I = 2.8 \\
\ell = 0.55 \\
B =0.26 \\
F_{B} = 2.8 \cdot 0.55 \cdot 0.26 \\
F_{B} = 0.4004
\end{align}
$$
#### CD
$F_{B} = 0$

### 36
Two insulated wires, each $2.40 m$ long, are taped together to form a two-wire unit that is $2.40 m$ long. One wire carries a current of $7.00 A$; the other carries a smaller current $I$ in the opposite direction. The two-wire unit is placed at an angle of $65.0\degree$ relative to a magnetic field whose magnitude is $0.360 T$. The magnitude of the net magnetic force experienced by the two-wire unit is $3.13 N$. What is the current $I$?

$$
\begin{align}
F_{B} = I\ell B \sin \theta \\
 3.13= (7-I)\cdot 0.360 \cdot \sin 65 \cdot 2.4 \\ \\

\frac{3.13}{0.360 \cdot \sin 65 \cdot 2.4} = 7-I \\ \\

\frac{3.13}{0.360 \cdot \sin 65 \cdot 2.4} \cdot - 7 = -I \\ \\

I = \left(\frac{3.13}{0.360\cdot\sin\left(65\right)\cdot2.4}-7\right) \\ \\

I = 3.002809159 A
\end{align}
$$

A long solenoid has a length of $0.65 m$ and contains $1400$ turns of wire. There is a current of $4.7 A$ in the wire. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field within the solenoid?

$$
\begin{align}
B = M_{0} \frac{N}{L}I \\
B = M_{0} \frac{1400}{0.65}4.7 \\
B = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \cdot \frac{1400}{0.65} \cdot 4.7 \\
B = 0.01272103364
\end{align}
$$

### 60
A long, straight wire carrying a current of $305 A$ is placed in a uniform magnetic field that has a magnitude of $7.00 \times 10^{-3} T$. The wire is perpendicular to the field. Find a point in space where the net magnetic field is zero. Locate this point by specifying its perpendicular distance from the wire.

$$
\begin{align}
7.00 \times 10^{-3} = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7})\cdot 305}{2\pi r} \\
r = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7})\cdot 305}{2\pi \cdot 7.00 \times 10^{-3}} \\
r = 0.008714285714
\end{align}
$$

### 80
The drawing shows four insulated wires overlapping one another, forming a square with
$0.050m$ sides. All four wires are much longer than the sides of the square. The net magnetic field at the center of the square is $61\mu T$. Calculate the current $I$.

![[Pasted image 20230331134543.png]]
$$
\begin{align}
B = \frac{M_{0}I}{2\pi r} \\
B = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \cdot 3.9}{2\pi \cdot 0.05} \\
B = 15.6\times \mu T
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
B = \frac{M_{0}I}{2\pi r} \\
B = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \cdot 8.5}{2\pi \cdot 0.05} \\
B = 34\times \mu T
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
B = \frac{M_{0}I}{2\pi r} \\
B = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \cdot 4.6}{2\pi \cdot 0.05} \\
B = 18.4\times \mu T
\end{align}
$$
these three all have a magnetic field into the board so we can add them together 
$$
18.4+34+15.6 = 68
$$
because the last wire has a force out of the board we know that it's force is 
$$
68-61 = 7
$$
and we just plug that into the equation and solve for current
$$
\begin{align}

7 \times 10^{-6} = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \cdot I}{2\pi \cdot 0.05} \\
I = \frac{(2\pi \cdot 0.05)\cdot (7\times 10^{-6})}{4\pi \times 10^{-7}} \\
I = 1.75 A
\end{align}
$$
