# Questions:

1.  In an RC circuit, current flows from the battery until the capacitor is completely charged.  Is the total energy supplied by the battery equal to the total energy stored by the capacitor?  If not, where does the extra energy go?
    
Yes, the energy stored in the capacitor is equal to the energy provided. If any energy was lost, then it was a marginal amount and would have been lost in the form of heat radiating off of the circuit.
  
  

2.  With two identical lightbulbs and two identical batteries, how would you arrange the bulbs and batteries in a circuit in order to get the maximum possible total power out.
    
You would want the batteries in series and the bulbs in parallel. You want the batteries in series because the voltages will add, and you want the bulbs in series because it will allow each bulb to receive the same amount of power as a single lightbulb would, whereas lightbulbs in series diminish in brightness every time another bulb is added.
  
  
  

3.  Suppose that three identical capacitors are connected to a battery.  Will they store more energy if connected in series or in parallel?
    
In parallel, because each capacitor will receive the same amount of power as if it was a single capacitor attached to a battery, as opposed to in series, where with each capacitor that is added, the power supplied is less.
  
  

4.  Why are batteries connected in series?  Why in parallel?  Does it matter if the batteries are nearly identical or not?
Batteries are connected in series when you want pure power, because the power from the batteries will add together. When batteries are connected in parallel, the total power supplied is the same as just one battery, while drawing from several. This allows circuits with batteries in parallel to remain just as functional as it usually is, even if one battery is dead. No.

## 54.
A $16\Omega$ loudspeaker, an $8\Omega$ loudspeaker, and a $4\Omega$ loudspeaker
are connected in parallel across the terminals of an amplifier. Determine
the equivalent resistance of the three speakers, assuming that they all
behave as resistors.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{REQ} = \frac{1}{16}+\frac{2}{16}+\frac{4}{16} = \frac{7}{16} \\
REQ = \frac{16}{7} = 2.29
\end{align}
$$

## 56.
Two identical resistors are connected in parallel across a
$25V$ battery, which supplies them with a total power of $9.6W$. While
the battery is still connected, one of the resistors is heated so that
its resistance doubles. The resistance of the other resistor remains
unchanged. Find (a) the initial resistance of each resistor and (b) the
total power delivered to the resistors after one resistor has been
heated.


### (A)
$$
P = v^2R
V = IR
\frac{2.25V^2}{9.6}=R
$$
### (B)
$$
2r_{1}\cdot \frac{r_{2}}{r+r_{2}}=\frac{2r^2}{3r}=\frac{2}{3}r=
$$

## 64.

## 96.
Two capacitors are connected to a battery. The battery voltage is $V = 60.0V$, and the capacitances are $C_{1} = 2.00\mu F$ and $C_{2} = 4.00\mu F$. Determine the total energy stored by the two capacitors when they are wired (a) in parallel and (b) in series.

  

### (A)

$U = \frac{1}{2}CV$

  

$\frac{1}{CEQ} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$

$CEQ = \frac{4}{3}$

$U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot 60 = 40$

### (B)

$CEQ = 4+2=6$

$U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 60 = 180$

## 104.

A circuit contains a resistor in series with a capacitor, the series combination being connected across the terminals of a battery, as in Figure 20.37a. The time constant for charging the capacitor is 1.5 s when the resistor has a resistance of $2.0 \times 10^4 \Omega$. What would the time constant be if the resistance had a value of $5.2 \times 10^4 \Omega$?

  

$\tau = RC$

$1.5 = 2.0 \times 10^4\Omega C$

$C = \frac{1.5}{2.0 \times 10^4} = 0.000075$

  
  

$\tau = (5.2 \times 10^4)\cdot0.000075 = 3.9 s$
