# Questions:

## 1.  
Can a copper wire and an aluminum wire of the same length have the same resistance?  Explain.  
    
Yes, since resistance is not tied to a specific material there are variables in the resistance formula that we can change to make the copper and aluminum wire have the same resistance. For example the resistivity of copper is $1.77 \times 10^{-8}\Omega \cdot m$ and the resistivity of aluminum is $2.65 \times 10^{-8}\Omega \cdot m$ and the formula for the resistance of a wire is $R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$ since the resistivity of the copper is larger that means that the cross-sectional area of the copper wire needs to be higher in order to have the same resistance as the aluminum wire.

So, in other words, the copper wire and the aluminum wire can have the same resistance if the copper wire is thicker than the aluminum by a specific amount.
  
  

## 2.  
Explain why light bulbs almost always burn out just as they are turned on and not after they have been on for some time.
    
We know that the time the electrons in the lightbulb are in an excited state is only when energy is first flowing through it. Therefore, that is when the lightbulb is most volatile. So, when the lightbulb is first turned on, that is when the lightbulb is most likely to burn out. Because after the lightbulb has been on after a while, the electrons are not in an excited state, so it is less likely to burn out then.
  
  

## 3.  
Why is it dangerous to replace a 15-A fuse that blows repeatedly with a 25-A fuse?
    

  Because it will allow more electricity through than the 15-A fuse that blew. Meaning that instead of blowing and protecting the rest of the circuit, the 25-A fuse will allow dangerous amounts of electricity through that will damage the parts that the 15-A fuse was protecting.

## 4.  
Develop an analogy between blood circulation and an electrical circuit.  Discuss what plays the role of battery, resistor, and current in your analogy.
    
The battery/power source is the heart, as it is providing blood/electricity to the rest of the body/circuit. The current of the circuit is the blood flow, the faster electricity flows the higher the current and the faster the blood flows the higher the blood flow. The resistors are what slow down the flow of electricity, or in this case the flow of blood. We know that blood vessels control blood flow, so in this case the blood vessels would be the resistors.
  
  

## 5.  
When a battery is connected to a capacitor, why do the two plates acquire charges of the same magnitude?  Will this be true if the two conductors are different sizes or shapes? 
    
Because the same voltage is being distributed across them. This would still be true regardless of size or shape.
  
  
  
  

## 6.  
How does the energy stored in a capacitor change when a dielectric is inserted if (a) the capacitor is isolated so $Q$ doesn’t change, (b) the capacitor remains connected to a battery so $V$ doesn’t change?
    
$E = \frac{1}{2}\cdot C \cdot V^2$

  ### (A)

The energy stored stays the same because $Q = CV$, so the values in the energy equation would stay the same if $Q$ stayed the same.
  
  ### (B)
  
Because $V$ remains constant when the dielectric is inserted, that means that $C$ must increase, because $C = KC_{o}$. So $C$ increases and $V$ remains constant, meaning the energy stored increases.

## 42.
What is the capacitance of a capacitor that stores $4.3\mu C$ of charge on its plates when a voltage of $1.5V$ is applied between them?

$$
\begin{align}
q = CV \\
C = \frac{q}{V} \\
C = \frac{4.3 \times 10^{-6}}{1.5V} \\
  \\
C = 2.86666667×10−6 F
\end{align}
$$

## 46.
The same voltage is applied between the plates of two different capacitors. When used with capacitor A, this voltage causes the capacitor to store $11 \mu C$ of charge and $5.0 \times 10^{-5}J$ of energy. When used with capacitor B, which has a capacitance of $6.7\mu F$, this voltage causes the capacitor to store a charge that has a magnitude of $q_{b}$. Determine $q_{b}$

$$
\begin{align}
Energy = \frac{1}{2}qV \\
  \\
5.0 \times 10^{-5}J = \frac{1}{2}(qV) \\
10 \times 10^{-5} J = 1.1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot V  \\
V = 9.\bar{09} \\

\\
\\ \\
q = CV\\
q_{b} = (6.7 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (9.\bar{09}) \\
q_{b} = 6.09 \times 10^{-5}C
\end{align}
$$


## 48.
Two capacitors are identical, except that one is empty, and the other is filled with a dielectric ($k = 4.50$). The empty capacitor is connected to a $12.0V$ battery. What must be the potential difference across the plates of the capacitor filled with a dielectric so that it stores the same amount of electrical energy as the empty capacitor?

$$
\begin{align}
C_{1} = \frac{\epsilon_{0}A}{d}\\ \\

C_{2} = \frac{4.5\epsilon_{0}A}{d}
\end{align}
$$
Since we know the capacitors are identical, we can cancel out A and d.

$$
\begin{align}

C_{1} = \epsilon_{0} \\ \\

C_{2} = 4.50 \cdot\epsilon_{0} 
\\  \\

E_{1} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \epsilon_{0} \cdot 12 \\
E_{1} = 5.3124\times 10^{-11} \\
  \\
E_{1} = E_{2} \\
  \\
E_{2} = 5.3124\times10^{-11} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4.5 \cdot \epsilon_{0} \cdot V \\
  \\
V = \frac{5.3124\times10^{-11}}{\frac{1}{2} \cdot 4.5 \cdot \epsilon_{0}}  \\
  \\
V = \frac{8}{3} = 2.6666667
\end{align}
$$

## 10.
The resistance and the magnitude of the current depend on the path the current takes. The drawing shows three situations in which the current takes different paths through a piece of material. Each of the rectangular pieces is made from a material whose resistivity is $\rho = 1.50 \times 10^{-1}\Omega \cdot m$, and the unit of length in the drawing is $L_{0} = 5.00cm$. Each piece of material is connected to a $3.00V$ battery. Find (a) the resistance and (b) the current in each case.
