Please complete the following questions and submit them in Google Classroom.  Some questions are written here and some are found in your textbook.  Please be complete in your answers, explaining the concepts for the short answer questions and showing your work for the mathematical problems.  Space is provided for you to answer the questions, so please copy this document and submit that copy.  If you choose to work on a separate sheet of paper, please attach a clear image of your work to this document.  Ideally you are only uploading one file. 

  

## Questions:

1.  Explain how both double-slit interference and diffraction are evidence of the wave theory of light.

Double slit interference causes the "wave" of light to form sections of constructive and destructive interference, similar to how two different speakers can create pockets that are louder and quieter. The light acts similarly to how the sound wave acts, the important difference being that light is not a wave. 



  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

2.  Monochromatic red light is incident on a double slit and the interference pattern is viewed on a screen some distance away.  Explain how the fringe pattern would change if the red light source is replaced by a blue light source.
    

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

3.  We can hear sounds around corners, but we cannot see around corners; yet both sound and light are waves.  Explain the difference.
    

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

4.  When white light passes through a flat piece of window glass, it is not broken down into colors as it is by a prism.  Explain.

7.  For both converging and diverging lenses, discuss how the focal length for red light differs from that for violet light.

	The dark fringe for $m = 0$ in a Young’s double-slit experiment is located at an angle of $\theta = 15$. What is the angle that locates the dark fringe for $m = 1$?

6
	Two parallel slits are illuminated by light composed of two wavelengths. One wavelength is $\lambda_{A} = 645$ nm. The other wavelength is $\lambda_{B}$ and is unknown. On a viewing screen, the light with wavelength $\lambda_{A} = 645$ nm produces its third-order bright fringe at the same place where the light with wavelength $\lambda_{B}$ produces its fourth dark fringe. The fringes are counted relative to the central or zeroth-order bright fringe. What is the unknown wavelength?

You are standing in air and are looking at a flat piece of glass ($n = 1.52$) on which there is a layer of transparent plastic ($n = 1.61$). Light whose wavelength is $589$ nm in a vacuum is incident nearly perpendicularly on the coated glass and reflects into your eyes. The layer of plastic looks dark. Find the two smallest possible nonzero values for the thickness of the layer.

	When monochromatic light shines perpendicularly on a soap film ($n = 1.33$) with air on each side, the second-smallest nonzero film thickness for which destructive interference of reflected light is observed is $296$ nm. What is the vacuum wavelength of the light in nm?

26
	A slit has a width of $W_{1} = 2.3 \cdot 10^{-6}$ m. When light with a wavelength of $\lambda_{1} = 510$ nm passes through this slit, the width of the central bright fringe on a flat observation screen has a certain value. With the screen kept in the same place, this slit is replaced with a second slit (width $W_{2}$), and a wavelength of $\lambda_{2} 740$ nm is used. The width of the central bright fringe on the screen is observed to be unchanged. Find $W_{2}$.
