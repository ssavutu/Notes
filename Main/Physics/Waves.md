# Standing Waves on String

 L = $\frac{n*\lambda_n}{2}$
 $\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}$

 - Frequency is in Hz, fundamental frequency of standing waves is 100 hz, and that scales with the standing wave number. As the standing wave number increases so does the frequency
 - As n increases $\lambda$ decreases and frequency increases
  V = $\lambda f$
  
  F = $\frac{v}{\lambda}$ 
  
 # $F_{n}= V \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda n}$
 
 $F_{n}= \frac{V}{1} \cdot \frac{n}{2L}$

 $F_{n} = nF_1$ 
	-frequency of the harmonic = n $\cdot$ fundamental frequency


nodes = n+1
antinodes = n

# Doppler Effect

$F_{o} = F_{s} \cdot [ \frac{V \pm V_{o}}{V \pm V_{s}}]$

V = 343 m/s = speed of sound

numerator increase = observed frequency increases

denominator increase = observed frequency decreases

 $S ----> observer$
	- $F_0$ increases
	- denominator must decrease
	- so - sign in the denominator
	- 
$S<------          observer$
	- $F_{o}$ increases
	- numerator must increase
	- so + sign in the numerator
$observer <------ S$
	- $F_o$ decreases
	- numerator must decrease
	- so - sign in the numerator
