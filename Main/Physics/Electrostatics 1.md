## Questions:

1.  Why does a plastic ruler that has been rubbed with a cloth have the ability to pick up small pieces of paper?  Why is this difficult to do on a humid day?
    

	When a plastic ruler(an insulator) is rubbed against a piece of cloth, it picks up electrons, giving it a negative charge(this is known as charging by friction). This negative charge causes the protons in the paper to be attracted to it and the electrons to be repelled, making the paper stick to it. 

	On a humid day, water molecules may come into contact with the ruler, when they touch some of the electrons on the ruler, some of the electrons may transfer to the water. This will make the ruler less charged, and therefore less able to pick up the paper.

2.  When a charged ruler attracts small pieces of paper, sometimes a piece jumps quickly away after touching the ruler.  Explain.

	  When it touches the paper the excess electrons spread out between both, when the electrons are evenly distributed the paper may fall either because the ruler is no longer negatively charged enough or because the paper now has a slight negative charge the objects repel each other. The charge could have also transferred to water molecules in the air, making the objects neutral.
  
  
  

3.  If you charge a pocket comb by rubbing it with a silk scarf, how can you determine if the comb is positively or negatively charged?

	  You can use an electrometer to find out the charge of the comb.


4.  What property makes metal a good electrical conductor and rubber a poor electrical conductor?

	The ease with which electrons are able to move through these materials determines how conductive they are. Metals contribute all of their valence/outer electrons into an "electric sea". This means that electrons in metal are able to move easily through the valence shells of the metal. Compared to rubber where the valence electrons do not move as freely.




5.  Assume that the two opposite charges in the figure below are $12.0$ cm apart.  Consider the magnitude of the electric field $2.5$ cm from the positive charge.  On which side of this charge - top, bottom, left, or right - is the electric field the strongest?  Weakest?

6.  Why can electric field lines never cross?

Because a given point/vector on the electric field can never have more than one direction.



7.  Consider the electric field at the three points indicated by the letters A, B, and C in the figure below.  First draw an arrow at each point indicating the direction of the net force that a positive test charge would experience if placed at that point, then list the letters order of decreasing field strength.

## Book Problems: 

Chapter 18: 4, 6, 8, 14, 20, 32, 34, 38, 42

### 4.
Four identical metal spheres have charges of $q_{a} = -8.0$ $\mu$C, $q_{b}= -2.0$ $\mu$C, $q_{c} = +5.0$ $\mu$C, and $q_{d} = +12$ $\mu$C.

(a) Two of the spheres are brought together so they touch, and then they are separated.
Which spheres are they, if the final charge on each one is $+5.0$ $\mu$C?

The spheres would have to be $q_{d} \text{ and } q_{b}$ 

(b) In a similar manner, which three spheres are brought together and
then separated, if the final charge on each of the three is $+3.0$ $\mu$C?

The spheres brought together would be $q_{a}$, $q_{c}$$\text{ ,}$ and $q_{d}$.

(c) The final charge on each of the three separated spheres in part (b) is
$+3.0$ $\mu$C. How many electrons would have to be added to one of these
spheres to make it electrically neutral?

According to google, there are $6.25 \times 10^{12}$ electrons to 1 $\mu$C, so you would need to add $1.875 \times 10^{13}$ electrons to make one of the spheres electrically neutral.


### 6.
A plate carries a charge of $-3.0$ $\mu$C, while a rod carries a charge
of $+2.0$ $\mu$C. How many electrons must be transferred from the plate to
the rod, so that both objects have the same charge?

You would need to transfer -2.5 $\mu$C worth of electrons. According to google 1$\mu$C = $6.25 \times 10^{12}$. So you would need to transfer $1.5625 \times 10^{13}$ electrons.


### 8.
In a vacuum, two particles have charges of $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$, where $q_{1} =+3.5$ $\mu$C.
They are separated by a distance of 0.26 m, and particle 1 experiences an
attractive force of 3.4 N. What is $q_{2}$ (magnitude and sign)?

$$
\begin{align}
FE = \frac{k \cdot q_{1} \cdot q_{2}}{r^2} \\
  \\
FE = 3.4N \\
r = 0.26 m \\
q_{1} = +3.5\mu \text{C} \\ \\

3.4N = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9) \cdot(+3.5 \times 10^{-6})\text{C} \cdot q_{2}}{(0.26)^2} \\
 
q_{2} = \frac{3.4 \cdot 0.36^2}{(8.99 \times 10^{9}) \cdot 3.5 \times 10^{-6}} \\
  \\
\end{align}
$$
So $q_{2} = -7.3046 \cdot 10^{-6}$


### 14.
The drawings show three charges that have the same magnitude
but may have different signs. In all cases, the distance $d$ between the
charges is the same. The magnitude of the charges is $|q| = 8.6$ $\mu$C, and
the distance between them is $d = 3.8$ mm. Determine the magnitude of
the net force on charge 2 for each of the three drawings.

![[Pasted image 20230202201545.png]]

#### (a)

The force from $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ :
$$
\begin{align}
r = 0.0038 m \\
q_{1} = -8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
q_{2} = 8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
FE = \text{?} \\
  \\
FE = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9}) \cdot (+8.6 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot(-8.6\times 10^{-6}) }{(0.0038m)^2} \\
  \\
FE = -46045.73 N
\end{align}
$$
The force from $q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$ :

$$
\begin{align}
r = 0.0038m \\
q_{2} = 8.6 \times 10^{-6} \\
q_{3} = 8.6 \times 10^{-6} \\
FE = \text{?} \\
  \\
FE = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9}) \cdot (+8.6 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot(+8.6\times 10^{-6}) }{(0.0038m)^2}  \\ 
  \\

FE = 46045.73N
\end{align}
$$

So, the force from $q_{1}$ is $-46045.73N$, and the force from $q_{3}$ is $46045.73N$ of force. So the net force on $q_{2}$ is $FE = 0N$ of force.


#### (b)

The force from $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ : 
$$
\begin{align}
r = 0.0038 m \\
q_{1} = 8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
q_{2} = 8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
FE = \text{?} \\
  \\
FE = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9}) \cdot (+8.6 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot(+8.6\times 10^{-6}) }{(0.0038m)^2} \\
  \\
FE = 46045.73 N
\end{align}
$$

The force from $q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$ :

$$
\begin{align}
r = 0.0038 m \\
q_{1} = 8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
q_{2} = 8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
FE = \text{?} \\
  \\
FE = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9}) \cdot (+8.6 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot(+8.6\times 10^{-6}) }{(0.0038m)^2} \\
  \\
FE = 46045.73 N
\end{align}
$$

So the force from $q_{1}$ is $46045.73N$ of force to the right and the force from $q_{3}$ is $46045.73N$ of force to the left. So the net force on $q_{2}$ is $FE = 92091.46N$.


#### (c)

The force from $q_1$ and $q_{2}$ :

$$
\begin{align}
r = 0.0038 m \\
q_{1} = +8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
q_{2} = -8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
FE = \text{?} \\
  \\
FE = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9}) \cdot (+8.6 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot(-8.6\times 10^{-6}) }{(0.0038m)^2} \\
  \\
FE = -46045.73 N
\end{align}
$$


The force from $q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$ :

$$
\begin{align}
r = 0.0038 m \\
q_{3} = +8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
q_{2} = -8.6 \times 10^{-6}\text{C} \\
FE = \text{?} \\
  \\
FE = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9}) \cdot (+8.6 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot(-8.6\times 10^{-6}) }{(0.0038m)^2} \\
  \\
FE = -46045.73 N
\end{align}
$$
So now we can calculate the force by finding the hypotenuse of the two magnitudes.

$$
\begin{align}
\sqrt{  C^2 = 92091.46} \\
C = -303N
\end{align}
$$
So the force on $q_{2}$ is $FE = 303N$

### 20. 
The drawing shows an equilateral triangle, each side of which has a length of 2.00 cm. Point charges are fixed to each corner, as shown. The 4.00 $\mu$C charge experiences a net force due to the charges $q_{a}$ and $q_{b}$. This net force points vertically downward and has a magnitude of $405 N$. Determine the magnitudes and algebraic signs of the charges $q_{a}$ and $q_{b}$.

### 32. 
Review the important features of electric field lines discussed in Conceptual Example 13. Three point charges ($+q$, $+2q$, and $-3q$) are at the corners of an equilateral triangle. Sketch in six electric field lines between the three charges.

![[Note Feb 9, 2023 1.png]]

### 34. 
The drawing shows two situations in which charges are placed on the x and y axes. They are all located at the same distance of $6.1 cm$ from the origin $O$. For each of the situations in the drawing, determine the magnitude of the net electric field at the origin.


![[Pasted image 20230202201745.png]]

#### (a)

The magnitude of $+2.0\mu C$ at the origin
$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{kq}{r^2} \\
r = .061m \\
q = +2.0 \times 10^{-6}C \\ \\


E = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9})\cdot(2 \times 10^{-6})}{0.061m^{2}} \\
E = 4832034.4
\end{align}
$$
The magnitude of $-3.0\mu C$ at the origin

$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{kq}{r^2} \\
r = .061m \\
q = -3.0 \times 10^{-6}C \\ \\


E = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9})\cdot(-3 \times 10^{-6})}{0.061m^{2}} \\
E = -7248051.599
\end{align}
$$

We can combine these into $12080086N$ of force to the right

The magnitude of $-5.0 \mu C$ at the origin

$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{kq}{r^2} \\
r = .061m \\
q = -5.0 \times 10^{-6}C \\ \\


E = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9})\cdot(-5 \times 10^{-6})}{0.061m^{2}} \\
E = -12080086
\end{align}
$$

And this is $12080086N$ of force upwards

So the magnitude at the origin is $c^2 = 12080086^2 + 12080086^2$

So the magnitude at the origin is $17083821.47N$ of force up and to the right
#### (b)

Magnitude of $-1.0 \mu C$ at origin

$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{kq}{r^2} \\
r = .061m \\
q = -1.0 \times 10^{-6}C \\ \\


E = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9})\cdot(-1 \times 10^{-6})}{0.061m^{2}} \\
E = -2416017.2
\end{align}
$$
Magnitude of $+4.0\mu C$ at origin

$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{kq}{r^2} \\
r = .061m \\
q = +4.0 \times 10^{-6}C \\ \\


E = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9})\cdot(4 \times 10^{-6})}{0.061m^{2}} \\
E = 9664068.799
\end{align}
$$
We can combine this into $1208086N$ of force to the right

Magnitude of $+6.0 \mu C$ at origin

$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{kq}{r^2} \\
r = .061m \\
q = +6.0 \times 10^{-6}C \\ \\


E = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9})\cdot(6 \times 10^{-6})}{0.061m^{2}} \\
E = 14496103.2
\end{align}
$$

Magnitude of $+1.0 \mu C$ at origin

$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{kq}{r^2} \\
r = .061m \\
q = +1.0 \times 10^{-6}C \\ \\


E = \frac{(8.99 \times 10^{9})\cdot(1 \times 10^{-6})}{0.061m^{2}} \\
\\
E = 2416017.2
\end{align}
$$
We can combine this into $12080086N$ of force upwards

So the magnitude at the origin is $17083821.47N$ of force up and to the right.

### 42. 
Two charges are placed between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor. One charge is $+q_{1}$ and the other is $q_{2} = +5.00 \mu C$. The charge per unit area on each of the plates has a magnitude of $\sigma = 1.30 \times 10^{-4} C/m^{2}$. The magnitude of the force on $q_{1}$ due to $q_{2}$ equals the magnitude of the force on $q_{1}$ due to the electric field of the parallel plate capacitor. What is the distance $r$ between the two charges?
