## Blackbody Radiation:

3.  What aspect of the blackbody spectrum forced Planck to propose quantization of energy levels in its atoms and molecules?

## Photoelectric Effect:

4.  Which aspects of the photoelectric effect cannot be explained without photons? Which can be explained without photons? Are the latter inconsistent with the existence of photons?
    
The aspect of the photoelectric effect that cannot be explained without photons is that when the intensity or duration of light changes the kinetic energy of the electrons does not change. However, electrons being emitted due to light hitting a material can still be explained without photons, but the mechanism by which it is explained does make sense with the experiments that show the existence of photons. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

5.  Is visible light the only type of EM radiation that can cause the photoelectric effect?
    

  No, any type of light cause the photoelectric effect. Ultraviolet light is traditionally used in experiments.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## Photon Momentum:

6.  Why don’t we feel the momentum of sunlight when we are on the beach?
    

  Because the momentum photons carry is very small.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## Radioactive Decay

7.  Does the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decrease to exactly half its original value in one half-life? Explain in terms of the statistical nature of radioactive decay.
    
No, because the decay is random in nature, so it is unlikely that the number of nuclei will decrease to exactly half. 
  
  
  
  
  
  

8.  Spontaneous radioactive decay occurs only when the decay products have less mass than the parent, and it tends to produce a daughter that is more stable than the parent. Explain how this is related to the fact that more tightly bound nuclei are more stable. (Consider the binding energy per nucleon.)

As parent nucleus it decays it loses particles, as the number of particles decrease the stability of the element increases because the particles inside the nucleus get packed tighter together. As the distance between the particles decrease the stability of the nucleus because of the strong nuclear force. As the distance between particle increases the strong nuclear force becomes drastically weaker due to it's limited range of action. So the closer together the particles are the stronger the binding energy becomes.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

9.  Explain how a bound system can have less mass than its components. Why is this not observed classically, say for a building made of bricks?


  The sum of the individual masses of the separated protons and neutrons is greater by the amount $\Delta m$ than the mass of the stable nucleus because the binding energy used appears as extra mass. This isn't observed classically because in a building made of bricks you are only measuring the combined mass of the bricks and not the energy required to break them apart.
  
  
  
  
  
  

10.  Identify each type of nuclear radiation and describe its purpose in providing stability to a daughter nucleus.

The three main types of nuclear radiation are alpha $\alpha$, beta $\beta$, and gamma $\gamma$ radiation. 


  $\alpha$ decay increases the stability of the daughter nucleus through a process known as transmutation. During $\alpha$ decay a daughter nucleus is produced that has less protons in it, the remaining protons are carried away by $\alpha$ particles. This reduction in proton number makes the nucleus more stable due to the fact that elements with a higher number of protons, specifically over 83 become unstable. By reducing the number of protons the stability of the daughter nucleus increases. 
  
  
  
  $\beta$ decay increases stability by converting neutron into a proton and and electron, removing the electron in the form of a $\beta^{-}$ particle. This increases the of protons in the daughter nucleus by one. This increases stability when a nucleus has too many neutrons and not enough protons.
  


$\gamma$ decay increases the stability of the nucleus without transmutation. When a nucleus changes from an excited energy state(unstable) to a lower energy state(more stable) the excess energy is emitted in the form of a photon that we call a $\gamma$ ray.
  
  
  
## Fusion/Fission:

11.  Why does the fusion of light nuclei into heavier nuclei release energy?

When the light nuclei combine the mass of the single nucleus is less than the combined mass of the nuclei. The mass that does not go to the single nucleus is released as energy.

12.  How can a nuclear reactor contain many critical masses and not go supercritical? What methods are used to control the fission in the reactor?

By controlling the rate of the reaction. Nuclear reactors in the U.S use water as a coolant and as a moderator.  The water slows down the neutrons produced in the fission. Control rods are also used which can slow or completely stop a reaction. These controls rods are made of materials that can absorb neutrons such as boron. Since neutrons are necessary to continuing the chain reaction these methods allow nuclear reactors to effectively and safely control nuclear fission reactions.

  
13.  Explain why the fission of heavy nuclei releases energy. Similarly, why is it that energy input is required to fission light nuclei?

  
  When you split a heavy nuclei you not only separate it into parts but also release the binding energy. With heavy elements you will gain more energy back than it took to separate, in light elements the binding energy is weaker so you will not gain back more energy than it took to force the fission in the first place.

15.  Which has a greater momentum: an UV photon or an IR photon?

We know that the momentum of a photon is based on the equation $p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$ where h is Planck's constant. So the larger the wavelength of a photon, the less momentum it possesses. Because a UV photon has a wavelength of 10-400 nanometers and an IR photon has a wavelength of 700-1000 nanometers we know that the UV photon has a greater momentum.
  
  
  
  

16.  Which has a larger wavelength, a tennis ball or a bowling ball if both are moving at the same speed?

The tennis ball, because of the formula $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}=\frac{h}{p}$. We know that they have the same velocity and Planck's  constant stays the same, so the item with the larger mass will have the smaller wavelength. Assuming that the bowling ball isn't exceptionally light, it has more mass and therefore has a smaller wavelength. So the tennis ball weighs less, so it has a longer wavelength.
  
  
  
  

17.  Explain the importance of the Young double-slit experiment.

It proves that light exhibits wave like properties/is a warticle.
