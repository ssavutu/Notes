## Questions:

1.  Your eye looks into an aquarium and views a fish inside.  One ray of light that emerges from the tank from the fish is shown in the figure below.  Also shown is the apparent position of the fish as seen by the eyeball.  In the drawing, indicate the approximate position of the actual fish.  Briefly explain your reasoning.

Because the light is going from a medium with a higher index of refraction to a lower index of refraction the light would bend away from the normal, meaning that the actual fish is probably closer to the normal.

2.  When you look into a swimming pool or a lake, are you likely to underestimate or overestimate its depth? Explain.

Because of apparent depth, you are likely to underestimate the depth. When looking at the water from an angle, the ray of light reflected from the bottom of the pool is going from a medium with a higher index of refraction to a medium with a lower index of refraction, causing the light to be bent away from the normal line. This means that the image of the bottom of the pool is offset from where the bottom of the pool actually is, and we perceive it to be closer.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

3.  When a wide beam of parallel light enters water at an angle, the beam broadens.  Explain.
    

  When the light enters the water, the light is traveling from a medium with high index of refraction to a medium with a low index of refraction. So that beam of light is bending, as this is happening the beam of light is scattered. So light travels outwards in more directions, making the beam broaden.
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
  

4.  Can a light ray traveling in air be totally reflected when it strikes a smooth water surface if the incident angle is right?
    

  
  If the incident angle is 0 then when the ray of light bounces back from the bottom of the water it will exit the water at the same angle, being perfectly reflected. However, if this question means perfectly reflected in the way that a mirror reflects light then the answer is no, because the water would absorb some of the light.
  
  
  
  
  
  

5.  A thin converging lens is moved closer to a nearby object.  Does the real image formed change in position or size?  If so, explain how.
    

  
  It will get bigger. As the $d_{o}$ decreases the $d_{i}$ increases and the magnification m = $-\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}}$ so as the object gets closer the magnification increases. Because the object cannot move past the lens, the image will always be real.
  
  
  
  
  
  

6.   A lens is made of a material with an index of refraction n = 1.3.  In air, it is a converging lens.  Will it still be a converging lens if placed in water?  Explain.
    

  No, because it is going from a lower index of refraction to a higher one, so it actually becomes a diverging lens.
  
  
  
  
  

## Book Problems: 

Chapter 26: 10, 16, 20, 32, 52, 66

$10.$ A layer of oil ($n = 1.45$) floats on an unknown liquid. A ray of light originates in the oil and passes into the unknown liquid. The angle of incidence is 64.0$\degree^{ }$, and the angle of refraction is 53.0$\degree^{}$. What is the index of refraction of the unknown liquid?

Snell's Law
	$n_{i}\sin(\theta_{i}) = n_{r}\sin\theta_{r}$

$n_{i} = 1.45$
$\theta_{i} = 64$
$\theta_{r} = 53$

$\frac{1.45 \cdot \sin(64\degree)}{\sin(53\degree)} = n_{r}$

$n_{r} = 1.632$

_1.632_
$16.$ The drawing shows a ray of light traveling through three materials whose surfaces are parallel to each other. The refracted rays (but not the reflected rays) are shown as the light passes through each material. A ray of light strikes the $a–b$ interface at a 50.0$\degree^{}$ angle of incidence. The index of refraction of material $a$ is $n_{a} = 1.20$. The angles of refraction in materials $b$ and $c$ are, respectively, 45.0$\degree^{}$ and 56.7$\degree^{}$. Find the indices of refraction in these two media.

Snell's Law
	$n_{i}\sin(\theta_{i}) = n_{r}\sin\theta_{r}$
	
$\theta_{i_{a}} = 50$
$n_{a} =1.20$
$\frac{1.20\ \cdot \sin(50 \degree)}{\sin(45\degree)} = n_{r}$

$n_{r} = 1.3$

$\frac{1.3 \cdot \sin(45\degree)}{\sin(56.7\degree)} = n_{r}$

$n_r = 1.099$

_A = 1.20
B = 1.3
C = 1.099_


$20.$ The drawing shows a rectangular block of glass ($n = 1.52$) surrounded by liquid carbon disulfide ($n = 1.63$). A ray of light is incident on the glass at point A with a 30.0$\degree^{}$ angle of incidence. At what angle of refraction does the ray leave the glass at point B?
![[Pasted image 20221114015630.png]]


Snell's Law
	$n_{i}\sin(\theta_{i} = n_{r}\sin\theta_{r}$

$1.63\cdot \sin(30\degree) = 1.52 \cdot \sin(\theta_{r})$

$\frac{1.63 \cdot \sin(30\degree)}{1.52} = \sin(\theta_{r})$

$\theta_{r} = 32.42\degree$

$\frac{1.52 \cdot \sin(32.42)}{1.63} = \sin(\theta_{r})$

$\theta_{r} = 29.99$

_29.99_

$32.$ The drawing shows three materials, $a$, $b$, and $c$. A ray of light strikes the $a–b$ interface at an angle that just barely exceeds its critical angle of 40.0$\degree^{}$. The reflected ray then strikes the $a–c$ interface at an angle of incidence that just barely exceeds its critical angle (which is not 40.0$\degree^{}$). The index of refraction of material $a$ is $n_{a} = 1.80$. Find the indices of refraction for the two other materials.

$52.$ When a diverging lens is held 13.0 cm above a line of print, as in Figure 26.29, the image is 5.0 cm beneath the lens. (a) Is the image real or virtual? (b) What is the focal length of the lens?
![[Pasted image 20221114020749.png]]


### (A)

_Virtual_

### (B)
Lens equation
	$\frac{1}{d_{f}} = \frac{1}{d_{o}} + \frac{1}{d_{i}}$

$d_{f} = \frac{1}{13} + \frac{1}{-5.0}$

$d_{f} = -\frac{8}{65}$

_-0.123_

$66.$ Two systems are formed from a converging lens and a diverging lens, as shown in parts $a$ and $b$ of the drawing. (The point labeled “$F_{converging}$” is the focal point of the converging lens.) An object is placed inside the focal point of lens 1 at a distance of 10.00 cm to the left of lens 1. The focal lengths of the converging and diverging lenses are 15.00 and -20.0 cm, respectively. The distance between the lenses is 50.0 cm. Determine the final image distance for each system, measured with respect to lens 2.
