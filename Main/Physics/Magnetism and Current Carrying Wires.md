- stator = stationary magnets
- rotor = loops of wire 
- commutator = changes current direction through the rotor
- $\tau$ = torque
- $\tau = F \cdot r$
- $F = I\ell B$
- the more loops in the rotor the more multiplicative the torque
- More current = more torque

As the motor spins the torque changes
