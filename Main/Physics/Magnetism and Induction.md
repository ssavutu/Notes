# Induction
- Induction
	- Magnetic Field through Loop of Wire $\rightarrow$ Current
		- only happens if the magnetic field is changing
- Faraday's Law
	- if a closed loop of wire experiences a change in magnetic flux, a current will be induced
	- Flux = flow through/how much a field flows through a surface = $\phi_{B} = B \cdot A$

	- Lenz's Law
		- The direction of the induced current is such that it would produce and induced magnetic field that opposes the change in flux.
		- $E = -\frac{\Delta \phi_{B}}{\Delta t}$
		- Simplified: Current is induced such that it creates a magnetic field that opposes $\Delta \phi$

\phi_{i} = (0.04 \cdot 0.01) \rightarrow \phi_{f}  = 0.008Wb  \\
\phi_{i} = 0.004 \rightarrow \phi_{f}  = 0.008Wb  \\

$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.004Wb}{.5} = 0.008V
