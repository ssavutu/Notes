 # Flux $/\Phi$(in Webers-Wb)

Flux is a of measure the amount of a field that points perpendicular through an area.
## Equations for different angles
- $\Phi_{B} = B\cdot A$

- $\Phi_{B} = B\cdot A \cdot \cos \theta$

- $\Phi = 0 Wb$

## Ways that Flux can change

- Changing the angle between the field and the area(shown above)
- Change the field strength $B$
- Change the area $A$
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta \Phi = \Delta B \cdot (A\cos \theta) \\
=\Delta A(B\cos \theta) \\
= (BA)\cos \Delta \theta
\end{align}
$$

## Example 
(note the cos is of 58)

## Faraday's Law

If there is a change in flux through a closed loop of wire then an E.M.F proportional to the change in flux
$$
\begin{align}
E = \frac{\Delta \phi_{B}}{\Delta T}\\
E = V = IR
\end{align}
$$

## Lenz's Law

The direction of current induced by Faraday's Law is in a direction such that the induced current will create a magnetic field opposing the change in flux.

### Using Lenz's Law
1. In what direction is $\Delta \phi_{B} = \phi_{f}-\phi_{i}$
2. Use RHR#2(current) on the loop to get the __Opposing__ $B$(Magnetic Field) based of the direction of current
