As you study this section, answer the following questions:

- What are the two classifications for how universal serial bus (USB) devices are powered?
- What is a digital visual interface (DVI) interface used for and why is it still useful?
- What is the video connection found on most televisions and entertainment systems?
- Why is the USB-C connection so popular?
- What is the hard drive connection frequently used in modern computers?
- What is Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) and why is it still used after 20 years?
- What does a Molex connector do?
- What can you do to connect older peripherals with newer computers?

In this section, you will learn to:

Key terms for this section include the following:

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|DB-9|A serial port with 9 pins that's used to connect many different serial devices such as a printer, scanner, router, etc. The D in the name is based on the D shape of the connector.|
|Recommend Standard 232  <br>(RS-232)|RS-232 was commonly used in computer serial ports. It has mostly been replaced with USB ports.|
|DisplayPort  <br>(DP)|A digital display port primarily used to connect to a computer monitor to carry high-quality digital video and audio signals, but not Ethernet data.|
|Integrated Drive Electronics  <br>(IDE)|A 40-pin connector and cable ribbon used to connect older hard drives to older motherboards. A separate Molex power cable is needed.|
|Micro-USB|A very small USB port found on many non-Apple cell phones, tablets, and other portable devices used to transfer power or data.|
|Serial Advanced Technology Attachment  <br>(SATA)|A 7-pin connector and cable frequently used in modern personal computers to connect hard drives to the motherboard. A separate power cable is needed.|
|Serial Attached SCSI  <br>(SAS)|A serial protocol that replaces parallel SCSI; it's typically used in enterprise-level storage systems.|
|USB4|Fourth generation of USB industry standards introduced in 2019 that provides a data transfer speed up to 40 Gbps. Also called USB4 Gen3x2 or USB4 40 Gbps.|
|Video Graphic Array  <br>(VGA)|A serial connector that transmits analog video and power to connect external display devices like monitors or projectors. VGA is a DE-15, 15-pin connector in three rows that has been used for many years and is frequently blue.|
