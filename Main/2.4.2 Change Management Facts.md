This lesson covers the following topics:

- Change request
- Change approval
- Implementation

## Change Request

Most organizations have an official approval process for change management. Change order forms are commonly used to document a change request. Change order forms are different at different companies, but they almost always require you to provide a few key things:

|Requirement|Description|
|---|---|
|Purpose of change|This section includes:<br><br>- Why do you want to make this change?<br>- Why is the change needed?<br>- Will it improve a current process, save money, or add additional functionality?<br>- Does the change align with the organization’s current mission and strategy?|
|Scope of change|The scope asks:<br><br>- What exactly do you want to change?<br>- What are the desired outcomes or deliverables?<br>- Will you need to request funding to cover new hardware or software?<br>- What about man-hours?<br>- Will you need programmers or technicians or administrative staff to work on the change?<br>- Who is the primary contact?<br>- Which existing systems will be impacted?<br>- Will there be down time?<br>- How will you know that the change is complete, and what quality control measures will you have in place to ensure that the project is complete?|
|Risk analysis|Risk analysis asks:<br><br>- What is likely to go wrong if we implement these changes?<br>- Are the risks worth it?|
|Backout plan|A backout plan specifies how you will return affected systems to their original states if your implementation fails.|

## Change Approval

After completing the change request form, it must be approved by a change board. A change board might consist of one person or many people. Change board members are chosen before the project starts. They are the people who must approve changes to the project. Board members might include:

- Managers
- Project managers
- Executive management
- Customers

## Implementation

During the implementation of a project, make sure to document all changes that have been made along the way. Include any approvals that you received along the way.

Once completed, be sure to follow your organization’s end-user acceptance process. This process ensures that someone who is going to be using the system verifies that it is working as expected. Be sure to document this verification as well.
