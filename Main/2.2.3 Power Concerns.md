# Concerns
- Power Spike: and increase in voltage lasting milliseconds
- Power Surge: an increase in voltage lasting seconds
- Power Sag: decrease in voltage
- Brownouts: decrease in voltage, stemming from too much strain on the grid
- Blackouts: no power, stemming from blown transformers, shorts, and downed lines

# Solutions
- Surge Protector: Filter out power surges
	- Condition power
	- Detect Surges and turn off devices
- UPS
	- Battery Backup
	- Automatically Provides power as needed
	- Provides power conditioning
	- Online UPS: PC draws power from battery in UPS which is constantly recharged from wall outlet, expensive and expires quickly
	- Offline UPS: Uses Bridge to run the system off the wall outlet without constantly charging the battery in the UPS, cheaper, millisecond of downtime while power switches over
- Selecting a UPS
	- Check power rating
	- Check Runtime
	- Plan for half of advertised runtime
	- Additional PCs reduce runtime
- Installing a UPS
	- Plug in to charge
	- Plug device into UPS protected outlet
	- Configure the UPS to work with the system for automatic shutdown
		- Connect over UPS
		- Load Drivers
		- Will allow UPS to shutdown computer cleanly
