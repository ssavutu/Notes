Fiber-optic cables deliver data, video, and voice services faster and more reliably than other cable systems.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Fiber-optic cable components
- Comparison
- Mode
- Connectors

## Fiber-optic Cable Components

A fiber-optic cable, also called an optical-fiber cable, is composed of the following components:

- The central core carries the signal. It is made of plastic or glass.
- The cladding maintains the signal in the center of the core as the cable bends.
- The protective layer provides a stiff structure to prevent the cladding and central core from breaking.
- The plastic sheath encases everything and protects the cable.

## Comparison

Fiber-optic cabling offers the following advantages and disadvantages as compared to other cable types:

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|---|---|
|Advantages of fiber-optic cable:<br><br>- Completely immune to EMI<br>- Highly resistant to eavesdropping<br>- Fastest available transmission rates<br>- Greater cable distances without a repeater|Disadvantages of fiber-optic cable:<br><br>- Very expensive<br>- Difficult to work with<br>- Special training required to attach connectors to cables|

## Mode

Multi-mode and single-mode fiber cables are distinct from each other and not interchangeable. The following table describes multi-mode and single-mode fiber cables.

|Mode|Description|
|---|---|
|Single-mode|Single-mode fiber-optic cable:<br><br>- Transfers data through the core using a single light ray (the ray is also called a mode).<br>- Has a core diameter of around 10 microns.<br>- Supports a large amount of data.<br>- Allows cable lengths to extend a great distance.|
|Multi-mode|Multi-mode fiber-optic cable:<br><br>- Transfers data through the core using multiple light rays.<br>- Has a core diameter of around 50 to 100 microns.<br>- Limits the distance of cable lengths.|

## Connectors

To connect computers using fiber optic cables, you need two fiber strands: one for transmitting and the other for receiving. Fiber optic cabling uses the following connectors:

|Connector|Description|
|---|---|
|ST Connector  <br>![Fiber optic ST connector](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_cbl_fbr_pp7/fb_cab180c.jpg)|An ST connector:<br><br>- Is used with single mode and multi-mode cabling.<br>- Is a keyed, bayonet-type connector.<br>- Is also called a push in and twist connector.<br>- Has a separate connector for each wire.<br>- Is nickel plated with a ceramic ferrule to ensure proper core alignment and prevent light ray deflection.<br>- Requires the exposed fiber tip to be polished as part of the assembly process. This ensures that light is passed from one cable to the next with no dispersion.|
|SC Connector  <br>![Fiber optic SC connector](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_cbl_fbr_pp7/fb_cab183c.jpg)|An SC connector:<br><br>- Is used with single-mode and multi-mode cabling.<br>- Is a push on, pull off connector type that uses a locking tab to maintain connection.<br>- Has a separate connector for each wire.<br>- Uses a ceramic ferrule to ensure proper core alignment and prevent light ray deflection.<br>- Requires the exposed fiber tip to be polished as part of the assembly process.|
|LC Connector  <br>![Fiber optic LC connector](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_cbl_fbr_pp7/fb_cab184c.jpg)|An LC connector:<br><br>- Is used with single-mode and multi-mode cabling.<br>- Is composed of a plastic connector with a locking tab, similar to an RJ45 connector.<br>- Is a single connector with two ends to keep the two cables in place.<br>- Uses a ceramic ferrule to ensure proper core alignment and prevent light ray deflection.<br>- Is half the size of other fiber optic connectors.|
|MT-RJ Connector  <br>![Fiber optic MT-RJ connector](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_cbl_fbr_pp7/fb_cab185c.jpg)|An MT-RJ connector:<br><br>- Is used with single mode and multi-mode cabling.<br>- Is composed of a plastic connector with a locking tab.<br>- Uses metal guide pins to ensure it is properly aligned.<br>- Is a single connector with one end that holds both cables.<br>- Uses a ceramic ferrule to ensure proper core alignment and prevent light ray deflection.|
