Twisted pair cables remain one of the primary ways that computers connect to a network.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Twisted pair cable connectors
- Wiring standards
- Ethernet pin specifications
- Cable tips

## Twisted Pair Cable Connectors

The table below describes the two types of connectors used with twisted pair cables.

|Connector|Description|
|---|---|
|RJ11<br><br>![RJ11 connector](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_cable_pp7/connect-cable-end_rj11-01.jpg)|The RJ11 connector:<br><br>- Has 4 or 6 connectors<br>- Conforms to the RJ-11 wiring standard which supports up to 2 pairs of wires (one phone and one power).<br>- Uses a locking tab to keep a connector secure in an outlet.<br>- Is used primarily for telephone wiring.<br>- Conforms to the RJ-14 and RJ-25 wiring standards which support additional phone lines using the same jack.|
|RJ45<br><br>![RJ45 connector](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_cable_pp7/connect-cable-end_rj45-01.jpg)|The RJ45 connector:<br><br>- Has 8 connectors.<br>- Supports up to 4 pairs of wires.<br>- Uses a locking tab to keep a connector secure in an outlet.<br>- Is used for Ethernet networks.|

## Wiring Standards

The table below illustrates patch (also called straight through) and crossover cable wiring using T568A and T568B standards. These are the termination standards used by the internet backbone infrastructure, internet providers, and businesses.

|Wiring|Description|
|---|---|
|![Patch cable wiring configuration](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_cable_pp7/st.jpg)  <br>Patch|Computers connect to the network through a hub or switch with a patch cable. Patch cables use the same wire configuration on each connector end. The most commonly used wiring configurations are:<br><br>- T568A Wires are arranged from pins 1 to 8 in each connector in the following order: GW, G, OW, B, BW, O, BrW, Br.<br>- T568B Wires are arranged from pins 1 to 8 in each connector in the following order: OW, O, GW, B, BW, G, BrW, Br.<br><br>It doesn't matter which standard you use as long as all cables use the same standard. This helps prevent confusion during troubleshooting.|
|![Crossover cable wiring configuration](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_cable_pp7/co.jpg)  <br>Crossover|Computers can connect directly to one another using a crossover cable.  <br>  <br>The easiest way to create a crossover cable is to arrange the wires in the first connector using the T568A standard and arrange the wires in the second connector using the T568B standard.|

## Ethernet Pin Specifications

Ethernet specifications use the following pins for communication:

- Cat 5 Ethernet (100BASE-T) and below. (Tx is a pin used for transmitting and Rx is a pin used for receiving).
    - Pin 1: Tx+
    - Pin 2: Tx-
    - Pin 3: Rx+
    - Pin 4: Unused
    - Pin 5: Unused
    - Pin 6: Rx-
    - Pin 7: Unused
    - Pin 8: Unused
- Cat 5e (1000BASE-T) and above. (Bi indicates the pin is used for both transmitting and receiving).
    - Pin 1: Bi+ D0
    - Pin 2: Bi- D0
    - Pin 3: Bi+ D1
    - Pin 4: Bi+ D2
    - Pin 5: Bi- D2
    - Pin 6: Bi- D1
    - Pin 7: Bi+ D3
    - Pin 8: Bi- D3

## Cable Tips

Be aware of the following when making cables for Ethernet:

- Use a crimping tool designed for RJ45 connectors to attach connectors to UTP cable. Most crimping tools include an integrated wire stripper that you can use to remove the outer sheath from the cable. This allows you to access the individual wires.
- Use the appropriate punch-down tool when connecting UTP cabling to a punch-down block. To use a punch-down tool, position the UTP wire into a slotted post in the punch-down block. With the punch-down tool, press down on the top of the wire over the post.
- Be sure to use the correct connector type. There are different connectors rated for solid or stranded core wires.
- Keep the pairs twisted as much as possible up to the connector. This helps reduce crosstalk.
- Be aware that making Cat 6 compliant cables is difficult. If you do not add the connectors exactly right, the cable will be capable of only 100 Mbps speeds. In most cases, it is easier to buy cables of the correct length than to try and make your own.
