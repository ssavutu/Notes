This lesson covers the following topics:

- Policies and procedures
- Security policies
- Network documents
- Knowledge base

## Policies and Procedures

_Policies_ are rules that have been set by an organization. Policies are often developed to align with an organization’s mission. _Procedures_ are directions that outline step-by-step information on how something should be done.

A standard operating procedure (SOP) provides detailed instructions for performing a complex or multi-faceted business activity. An SOP is carefully designed with a specific outcome in mind. And usually includes:

- Purpose and scope of the process
- The directions or steps needed to complete the process
- Required equipment, technologies, and supplies
- Common issues and solutions

All industries are responsible for maintaining compliance. Depending on the industry type, an organization may be accountable to the city, state, and industry regulations. Because IT systems impact all parts of an organization (production, HR, customer records, etc.), end-users and PC technicians should be familiar with policies and procedures.

Splash screens (typically displayed during a login process) can be used to display information about specific regulatory and compliance policies.

## Security Policies

A security policy is a document or a collection of documents that provide information about an organization’s network security.

|Document|Description|
|---|---|
|Password policy|An organization's password policy identifies the requirements for passwords used to authenticate to company-owned systems. For example, this policy may specify:<br><br>- Accounts should be disabled or locked out after a certain number of failed login attempts.<br>- Users should be required to change their passwords within a certain time frame.<br>- Users may not reuse old passwords.<br>- Users must use strong passwords. Strong passwords should not contain:<br>    - Words found in the dictionary.<br>    - Personally identifiable information, such as an employee's spouse's name, child's name, birth date, favorite sports teams, etc.<br>    - Part of a username or email address.<br><br>Password policies may also contain information about password management including:<br><br>- Rotation policies<br>- Lockout threshold<br>- Password expiration|
|Bring your own device  <br>(BYOD)|If your organization chooses to allow employees to use their personal devices for work-related tasks, you will want to have a BYOD policy. A BYOD policy includes:<br><br>- How and when users can use their devices.<br>- The types of devices that are permitted.<br>- Information about any monitoring that the device may be subject to.<br>- Security requirements for the device.|
|Backup policy|A backup policy includes the details for regular data backups. The policy should include:<br><br>- The types of backups to be completed.<br>- Who is permitted to access restricted areas where backups are stored.<br>- How access is provided (key, key fob, or smart card).<br>- How access is logged and monitored.|
|Physical security policy|A physical security policy indicates:<br><br>- Restricted areas within an organization.<br>- How access is provided (key, key fob, or smart card).<br>- How access is logged and monitored.|
|Acceptable use policy  <br>(AUP)|An acceptable use policy (AUP) defines an employee's rights to use company property, such as:<br><br>- Computer equipment.<br>- Computer data storage.<br>- Internet access.<br>- Email.<br><br>The policy will specify:<br><br>- Who has access to company resources.<br>- Restrictions on personal use of internet, email, and storage.<br>- Which browsers, applications, and hardware platforms are supported.|
|User education and awareness policy|The strongest security measures can be quickly defeated if employees engage in unsafe behaviors, such as:<br><br>- Clicking on links in a phishing email.<br>- Visiting malicious websites.<br>- Responding to social engineering attempts.<br>- Downloading and installing unauthorized software.<br><br>Employee awareness is key to preventing these behaviors. A user education and awareness policy is designed to:<br><br>- Familiarize employees with the organization’s security policy.<br>- Provide contact information.<br>- Identify general IT support available.<br>- Describe suspicious activities to be aware of.<br><br>A user education and awareness policy specifies content for mandatory training for end-users. The policy outlines how to communicate standards, procedures, and baselines that will help employees to safely and effectively do their jobs.|
|Technical procedures|An organization may have custom procedures that are followed when installing software applications or setting up new devices. These procedures would include step-by-step instructions, user access, security settings, and configurations.|

## Network Documents

Common network documents include:

|Document|Description|
|---|---|
|Network diagram|A network diagram provides a visual representation of the logical and physical layout of a network. A single diagram or a collection of diagrams can include:<br><br>- The location and IP addresses of hubs, switches, routers, and firewalls.<br>- The relationship between remote locations and the WAN links that connect them.<br>- Subnets within the network, including the subnet addresses and the routers connecting each subnet.|
|Floor plan|A floor plan provides a layout of all electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and network wiring components. For example, a server room’s floor plan would include information on server racks, the cooling systems, air circulation systems, fire suppression systems, etc.|

## Knowledge Base

A knowledge base is a web-based collection of articles and documents related to frequently asked questions. The knowledge base is usually accessible by both the end-user and the technicians. It can be used to:

- Help a user self-troubleshoot simple issues such as:
    - Resetting password.
    - Finding a printer.
    - Setting up an out-of-office message.
    - Changing a voicemail message.
- Send a user supporting information after an issue has been fixed.
- Help a PC technician troubleshoot an issue.
- Provide procedures and configurations for custom installations of software applications.
