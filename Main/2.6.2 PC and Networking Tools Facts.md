This lesson covers computer repair and maintenance tools.

## Computer Repair and Maintenance Tools

The following devices and components are used for computer repair and maintenance.

A loopback plug is used to test network communications by redirecting a signal from the transmit port on a device to the receive port on the same device. Use the loopback plug to verify that a device can both send and receive signals.

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|Crimper|A wire crimper, also known as a cable crimper, is used to secure connectors to the ends of network cables.|
|Cable stripper|A cable stripper is used to remove – or strip – the insulation from a wire. Crimpers and strippers can often be built into the same network tool.|
|WiFi analyzer|A WiFi analyzer can measure:<br><br>- Signal strength<br>- Network names<br>- Network security settings<br>- Network coverage<br><br>This information is valuable for wireless network documentation, expansion, or troubleshooting.|
|Toner probe|A toner probe has two parts:<br><br>- Audio-frequency tone generator (sends a signal into the wire that is being tested).<br>- Inductive amplifier probe (provides an audible tone if any signal is detected on the wire being tested).|
|Network tap|A device used to collect data on traffic traveling across a network. The tap is usually installed right into your network cabling.|
|Punch down tool|A punch down tool is used to secure cable wiring to a punch-down block or a patch panel.|
|3-pronged parts retriever|A 3-pronged parts retriever is used to grasp and retrieve small parts that have fallen into difficult-to-reach areas.|
|Multimeter|A device that tests various electrical properties. For example, most multimeters can measure:<br><br>- AC and DC voltage<br>- Current (amps)<br>- Resistance (ohms)<br>- Capacitance<br>- Frequency|
|Power supply tester|A custom multimeter used to test output from a PC power supply. The power supply tester has multiple connectors to test the output for each connector type.|
|Cable tester|A cable tester verifies that a network can carry a signal from one end to the other and that all wires within the connector are in the correct positions. Most testers have a single unit that tests both ends of the cable at once. Many testers come with a second unit that you can plug into one end of a long cable run to test the entire cable.|
|Loopback plug|A loopback plug is used to test network communications by redirecting a signal from the transmit port on a device to the receive port on the same device. Use the loopback plug to verify that a device can both send and receive signals.|
|Combination ratchet/screwdriver|A combination ratchet is a ratcheting handle with interchangeable bits that provides multiple features in a single tool.<br><br>- Bit ends can be replaced with Phillips and flat-head screwdrivers, hex sockets, and torx (star-shaped) bits.<br>- The ratcheting handle allows you to drive the screw without repositioning the driver.<br><br>Most computer components use Phillips head screws.|
|Antistatic pad/wrist strap|An antistatic pad provides an insulated covering to prevent static electricity from moving between objects and damaging computer components. When working with computer components, use a wrist strap connected to the antistatic pad and connect the pad to a ground.|
|Known good spares|Known good spares are a set of components that you know are in proper functioning order. If you suspect a problem in a component, swap it with the known good component. If the problem is not resolved, troubleshoot other components.|
