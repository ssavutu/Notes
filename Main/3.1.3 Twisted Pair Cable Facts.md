## Twisted Pair Cable Components

Twisted pair cabling is composed of the following components.

- Four pairs of copper wires carry the data signals. One wire in the pair carries a positive signal; the other carries a negative signal. Wires are twisted into pairs to reduce the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk.
- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic insulation surrounds each copper wire.
- An outer plastic sheath bundles the wires together and protects them.
    - Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) has only an outer plastic sheath. UTP cables are easier to work with and are less expensive than shielded cables.
    - Shielded twisted pair (STP) has a grounded outer copper shield around the entire wire bundle or around each wire pair. STP provides additional EMI protection, but costs considerably more than UTP.
- T568A and T568B are two major wiring standards used in the networking industry. The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) /Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) developed these standards that determine the order of the twisted pair wires placed in the RJ45 connectors when you are terminating a connection.

## Comparison

Twisted pair cable has the following advantages and disadvantages compared to other cable types:

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|---|---|
|- Inexpensive compared to other media types.<br>- Easy to install, flexible, and light weight.<br>- Very common media and tools are easy to obtain.<br>- The most common and most supported network medium.|- Is susceptible to interference.<br>- Is vulnerable to cable damage.<br>- Is vulnerable to eavesdropping.<br>- Has low bandwidth.|

## Categories

The following table describes the unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable categories and their specifications.

Even though cable categories may look physically similar, they are electrically different. Higher numbered cable categories have much faster transmission speeds because they use different wire gauges and have more wire twists per inch than lower numbered cable categories.

|Category|Connector|Speed|Frequency|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Phone cable|RJ11|10 Mbps|N/A|Used to connect a modem to a phone jack in a wall outlet to establish a dial-up internet connection.  <br>Has two pairs of cable (a total of 4 wires).|
|Cat 5|RJ45|100 Mbps|100 MHz|Supports up to 100 Mbps Ethernet.|
|Cat 5e|RJ45|1000 Mbps|100 MHz|Is similar to Cat 5 but provides better EMI protection. Supports gigabit Ethernet (gigabit connections require the use of all four twisted pairs).|
|Cat 6|RJ45|10 Gbps|250 MHz|Limits 10 Gbps speeds to cable lengths less than 55 meters.|
|Cat 6a|RJ45|10 Gbps|500 MHz|Limits 10 Gbps speeds to cable lengths less than 100 meters. Provides additional shielding and tighter cable twists than standard Cat 6, which reduces (alien) crosstalk and makes it less susceptible to EMI.|
|Cat 7|RJ45|10 Gbps|600 MHz|Has the strictest specifications for crosstalk and noise. In shielded only.|
|Cat 7a|RJ45|10 Gbps|1000 MHz|Offers exceptional noise immunity in addition to the strictest specifications for crosstalk and noise. In shielded only.|
|Cat 8.1|Class I: RJ45  <br>Class II: non-RJ45|25 Gbps|2000 MHz|Rated for data transfers 250 times faster than Cat5. Is not compatible with Cat5e and Cat6 cables due to different connectors. In shielded only.|
|Cat 8.2|Class I: RJ45  <br>Class II: non-RJ45|40 Gbps|2000 MHz|Rated for data transfers 400 times faster than Cat5. Is not compatible with Cat5e and Cat6 cables due to different connectors. In shielded only.|

Always use a special crimping tool to attach connectors to UTP cable.

Keep the following in mind when working with twisted pair cables:

- Each type of UTP cable can be substituted for any category below it, but never for a category above. For example, Cat 6 can be substituted for a task requiring Cat 5e; however, neither Cat 5 nor Cat 3 should be used for the task.
- Cat 5/5e/6/6a cables come with wires that have solid cores or stranded cores. Use solid core cables for longer runs inside walls or the ceiling; use stranded wires for drop cables where flexibility and frequent movement occurs.

## Rating

Twisted pair cable can be rated differently for specific purposes in various construction applications.

|Rating|Description|
|---|---|
|Direct burial|Direct burial cable is designed to be buried directly in the ground.<br><br>- Needs no additional protection of piping or sheathing.<br>- Built to tolerate heat, moisture, and other hazards.|
|General|Cables with general purpose rating are the minimum requirement in commercial installations including network patch cables.<br><br>- Complies with UL-1518 testing and vertical flame test.<br>- High toxicity when burned and gives off toxic and corrosive gasses.|
|Plenum|Plenum rated cable is laid in the plenum spaces of buildings and must meet rigorous fire safety standards. Air plenum spaces are the open areas above drop ceilings or below raised floors used for air circulation. Plenum cables are:<br><br>- Coated with flame retardant and use non-toxic plastics that don't smoke much.<br>- Regulated under the National Fire Protection Association standard NFPA-262 and 90A.|
|Riser|Riser rated cable is run between floors through open vertical shafts.<br><br>- Suited for areas not defined as plenum but may conduct fire from one floor to another.<br>- Is industry standard UL-1666 tested for flame propagation.<br>- Requires tests to be conducted with mounted vertically cable.|
