# Sequences
- $a_{n}$ represents the nth term in a sequence
- The **Explicit Rule** does not depend on the previous term: $a_{n} = n(n+2) + 2$
- The **Recursive Rule** depends on the previous term: 
	- For example, in this sequence you would need both $a_{n-1}$ to find $a_{n}$
$$
\text{need both}
\begin{cases}
a_{1 = 5} \\
a_{n} = a_{n-1}+3 \\
\end{cases}
$$
# Series
- a series is the sum of the terms in a sequence
$$
S_{n} = \sum^{n}_{i=1}\text{sequence}
$$
- $i$ is the index(where you are in the list)
- $\sum$ is the sum
- $3i - 1$ is an example sequence
- $n$ is what $i$ stops at
- basically a for loop that stops at n
- Example:
$$ S_{n} = \sum^{5}_{i=1}3i-1 = 2+5+8+11+14 = 40$$
