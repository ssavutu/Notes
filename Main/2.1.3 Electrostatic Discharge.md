# Static Charges
- Created when 2 objects come into contact and are separated: 1 object can steal electrons from the other and become negatively charged while the other becomes positively charged
- An electrostatic discharge occurs when these charged objects come into contact, when the charges balance out an electrostatic discharge occurs

# Component Damage
- Components can be damaged by a discharge of 100V
- Discharge is not noticeable until 300V

# Preventative Measures
- Discharge yourself: touch the metal PC case before working on components
- Use a Static Mat
- Use a Static Floor Mat
- Don't touch the cold or silver leads or the connectors, which may short circuits
- Use static shielding bags
- Pink and Blue bags are resistant but not shielding, so be extra careful
- Remove Static Producing Materials: Plastic, Styrofoam, etc.
- High Humidity is better for ESD prevention
