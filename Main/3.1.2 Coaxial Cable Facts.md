Coaxial cable is commonly used to convey data, video, and voice signals in radio, television, and broadband internet applications.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Coaxial cable components
- Comparison
- Cable grade
- Connectors

## Coaxial Cable Components

Coaxial cable is built with the following components:

- The _inner conductor_ is made of a copper core. It carries the data signals.
- The _insulator_ surrounds the inner conductor and keeps the signal separated from the mesh conductor. It is made of PVC plastic.
- The _braided mesh conductor_ is a second physical channel and also functions as a ground. It is made of aluminum or copper-coated tin.
- The _sheath_ is made of PVC plastic and encases the cable, protecting it from external elements.

## Comparison

Coaxial cable has the following advantages and disadvantages compared to other cable types:

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|---|---|
|Advantages compared to other cable types include:<br><br>- Less susceptible to electromagnetic Interference (EMI)<br>- Resistant to physical damage<br>- Large existing infrastructure|Disadvantages compared to other cable types include:<br><br>- Expensive<br>- Not very flexible (difficult to bend around corners)<br>- Multiple splitters degrade signal quality|

## Cable Grade

The table below describes the grade specifications of common coaxial cable.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Grade|Uses|Resistance Rating|
|RG-59|CCTV video systems; short cable lengths (less than 3 meters) are sometimes used for cable TV|75 ohms|
|RG-6|Cable TV, satellite TV, and broadband cable internet|75 ohms|

Because RG-6 can carry a higher-quality signal with much lower signal loss than RG-59, you should always use RG-6 cabling for coaxial cable implementations.

## Connectors

The following table describes the most common type of connectors used with coaxial cable:

|Connector|Description|
|---|---|
|BNC  <br>(Bayonet Neill-Concelman)<br><br>![BNC connector](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_coax_pp7/coaxial-connector-bnc-01.jpg)|The BNC connector is molded onto the cable. It is used:<br><br>- In legacy 10Base2 Ethernet networks<br>- In specialized industries<br>- To connect composite video displays on commercial video devices|
|F-Type<br><br>![F-Type connector](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_7032/pcpro2022v7-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_coax_pp7/coaxial-connector-f-type-crimp-01.jpg)|The F-Type connector is crimped onto the cable using a special tool. It is used to:<br><br>- Create cable and satellite TV connections<br>- Connect a cable modem to a broadband cable connection<br>    <br>    Some F-Type connectors can be twisted onto a cable without a special tool. However, these types of connectors can cause signal leakage.|
