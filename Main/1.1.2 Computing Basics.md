# Computer Components
- Hardware: physical components
- Software: instructions or data stored electronically

## Input Devices
- Takes external input and sends it to the computer: keyboard, mouse(optical and mechanical), touchscreen(resistive and capacitive)
## Processing Devices
- Analyzes signals from input information
	- CPU: Processes data according to instructions or software
	- RAM: Stores processed data for quick access and stores running software, also a part of [[#Storage Devices]], data is volatile, faster than any other storage device
## Storage Devices
- Any hardware that stores data
- Stored data can be persistent or volatile
	- Volatile is short term memory(RAM), erased when power is lost
	- Persistent is permanent
### Long Term Storage Devices
- Non-Volatile/Persistent Memory
- Hard Disk: Stores data on a spinning platter/disc
- SSD: Uses memory chips similar to RAM
- Flashdrive: Use memory chips
- SD: Secure Digital card
#### Optical Storage Devices
- CDs, DVDs, Blu-Ray
- Read Only, or Writable
- ROM stands for Read Only Memory
- Writable discs have an R and the end: CD-R vs CD-ROM
## Output Devices
- Any device that receives data and outputs it in a physical medium
- Monitor, Printer, Sound Card, etc.
## Networking Devices
- Used to create a network(group of 2 or more connected computers)
- Connecting Medium: Wires, WIFI, etc.
# Modular Design
- Standardized Components
- Interchangeable Components
- Non-Brand Specific
- Example: Hard Drive, Monitor, etc.
